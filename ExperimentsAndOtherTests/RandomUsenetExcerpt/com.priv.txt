Well, doesn't echo in here, anyway. A bit dusty, but a good light from the West 
Wing windows. Yes, a few carpets, some good art on the wall. Bookshelves over 
there. Desk and typer over there. A couple of reading lamps. Hmmm. I believe it'll 
work out quite nicely. Anyone else arrived yet?

The Task Committee on Telecommunications Facilities of the Technical 
Administrative Committee on Special Design Issues within the 
Structural Division of the American Society of Civil Engineers is 
conducting a survey of telecommunications tower performance. We would 
like to distribute this form as widely as possible. The purpose of 
the committee and survey is given in the introductory text to the 
survey form, copied below:

"INTRODUCTION TO QUESTIONNAIRE AIMS AND GOALS

Committee on Telecommunications Facilities Statement of Purpose: To 
advance knowledge of, encourage research on and evaluate methods of 
analysis, design, erection and materials utilization for 
telecommunications and related facilities and their components, both 
new and existing, to report the results of studies on these topics, 
and to develop specific criteria or code proposals for their design, 
analysis, maintenance and construction based on these results.

Committee Objectives: To provide a manual of guidance for the design, 
analysis, maintenance and construction of free-standing and guyed 
towers, earth satellite stations and their components, whether 
constructed for the purposes of microwave or long wave 
transmission/reception, radar facilities, or other uses. 

Purpose of Questionnaire: To determine any need by owners, users, 
designers and/or constructors of freestanding and guyed 
telecommunications towers for improvements in the design and 
construction methods and criteria through an approximate assessment 
of functional losses as perceived by the owners and users of these 
structures. Included in "functional loss" are collapses; loss of 
signal strength; transmission or reception failure; excessive, 
difficult or unreasonably costly maintenance; or other unsatisfactory 
performance of the structures, as perceived by the owner or user. 
Through this assessment to determine those areas requiring 
improvement in the design and construction of telecommunications 
towers, thereby permitting the preparation of written recommendations 
to enact those improvements."

Please advise if we may post this form, either as a WordPerfect of 
Microsoft Word file, to your website (with instructions on how this 
may be best accomplished), or fax or mail a copy of the form. 
Suggestions with regard to other interested organizations and 
companies is also very appreciated. 

The survey is only two pages long plus a cover sheet (text given 
above) and an optional fourth sheet. This information is vital 
towards understanding the needs for furthering the safety and 
functionality of freestanding and guyed towers world wide.

Thank you very much for your cooperation and reply. If you have any 
questions, please contact:

Well Bob- this is an interesting place you've chosen. I like what you've
done with it. A blank sheet.

I wonder what com.priv stands for computer privacy or communications privacy.

I miss the spinning icon of Telefinder, but thats about it. I never did
get it to look up new articles so I could read them off line.

I'll put this on my group list.

Well Alan,

I didn't want to get to fancy before I knew what I was doing. But at 
least we have a place to call home I hope. What did you think of the 
scanner? I was impressed. For the money that is quite a nice scanner. 
Considering the color printer I have, an HP 540C, I wouldn't need 
anything better than that one.

Bob

I liked it.  It would be nice to be able to play with it for a couple
hours with it hooked up to your machine. She has 20megs of ram I think. I
wonder how much you need. Those Paper Port Scanners cost just $100 less
and they only do black and white.

I saw a review on her scanner (lycos search) and it was luke warm. I think
these magazine people are spoiled. The ones they like are in the $1000
range.

I am looking at getting 28.8 Global Village modem first and the time to
buy RAM is now and they got some nice NEC laser printers for sale for
around $300 that even have postscript 2. What to do, what to do?

I am hesitant to charge anything on my credit card I can't pay off right
away. It took so long to pay it off when the balance got up there.

Her scanner impressed me quite a lot. I think it would meet most 
people's needs. It's that whole credit card thing that has kept me from 
getting it as well. It really is an unbelievable price, though. It's 
probably a vicious circle. Get a nice scanner, you'll want a better 
printer, get a better printer, you'll want a nicer scanner, etc. etc.

Did you see that Apple is going to cut their product line in half? They
should have done that along time ago. Of course these bargains on power
macs will probably dry up, but faster computers are a coming.

I was going thru old receipts, tossing out irrelevant ones. Found one for
my mac plus. For the Plus, Imagewriter II, extra floppy drive and Word=
$3,000!!!

This was  ten years ago dollars.  Mac plus was state of the art then.
Think of the incredible changes between a $3000 system then and now. Wow.
Color to name one.

I'm thinking of giving mine to my nephew. It has 5 megs of Ram in it. 
But I can't really think of anything to do with it. It is pretty slow 
for most things. I thought of taking it to school, but the thought of 
all those little grimy hands eventually tearing apart my beloved Mac is 
more than I can handle.

Ha! That less funny than you think. A girl from school called me at 2:30
am the other morning to tell me that she was going to go on a camp out
and she'd be bringing the food. When I answered the phone she got all
flustered. "Why are you answering the phone at this time in the
morning?" she asked. Only a woman could have that logic. She thought I
would let it go the answering machine.

I think you are right.  As I understand it, $9.95 for unlimited AOL and
$19.95 unlimited Internet.  I do not know about the variables therein.

Hello,

I have been seeing these "stupid" money posts over the net for the past
few months.  And I kept saying to myself, "I wish these idiots would 
stop posting advertisements on the net."  Well, I actually took time to
read a post and I was very intrigued with what I read.  Please, allow me
to take 5 minutes of your time to explain a money making system that has
the potential Return on Invenstment of $50,000.  I read it, very
skeptically, and analyzed it (it is based on the concepts of networking
and exponential growth), and found it to be a very plausible, and LEGAL
way to make money fast.


The process is very simple, and it consists of 3 EASY steps:
(It would be best to print this BEFORE you begin)

STEP 1:  Get 5 seperate pieces of paper and write the following on each
sheet of paper... "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.  YOU ARE NUMBER
(1, 2, 3 OR 4)." Get five $1 bills and place ONE inside each piece of 
paper so that you just wrote on, and fold each piece of paper so that
the bill will not be seen in the envelope (otherwise, nosey people who
like to steal envelopes with money in it will get yours).  Put one paper
inside the envelope and seal it.  Do the same for all 5.  You should now 
have 5 envelopes sealed, EACH have a piece of paper AND a $1 bill
stuffed inside of the paper.  Make sure those words that were stated
above are stated on each paper.  What you are doing is creating a
service by this, this is PERFECTLY LEGAL.  Now then, mail the envelopes
with the paper and $1 in each to the following 5 addresses:

1.     S. Shaw, 611 23rd Street, Sacramento, CA 95816
2.     M. Nawlo, 27 Crows Nest Ln. #17, Danbury, CT. 06810
3.     M. Smith, 389 East McDonel Hall, East Lansing, MI 48825
4.     J. Simpson, Brks 447 Box 769, NSA Memphis, TN 38054
5.     D. Brogan, PO Box 290755, Davie, FL 33329-0755

STEP 2:  Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the
other 4 names up (5 becoming 4, 4 becoming 3, ect.) and put YOUR NAME as
number 5 on the list.

STEP 3:  Post your amended article (with YOUR name at #5) to at least
200 newsgroups.  You could also distribute this through e-mail.  On a
college campus, campus mail and email is free, so use your imagination.
 For example, I can get an e-mail directory of students on the net on my
campus.  The idea is to appeal to as meany people like yourself, who
need money.  When you begin to receive names and money, save the names
in a file.  The people who send you money are paying you to save their
name, essentially, as proof that you gave them this opportunity.  By
saving the names, the business becomes legal, and you hold a record of
the people you licensed to continue the chain.

(If you have Netscape 3.0, and want to take the newsgroup option, follow
the instructions at the bottom of this letter)

THIS SYSTEM WORKS!!!

You only need an average return of 2.5%, that is FIVE PEOPLE, to make
more than $50,000.  Out of every 200 postings, let's say I ONLY receive
5 replies, which is actually VERY LOW.  So I made 5 dollars with my name
at #5.  Now then, each person who just sent me $1 makes, say only 200
postings, now with your name at number 4, WHICH IS A TOTAL OF 1000
POSTINGS, not including yours too.  Fifty people send you $1 now.  Now,
then your new 50 agents post 200 each with YOUR NAME AT NUMBER 3, OR
10,000 POSTINGS (50X200).  Average return is 500 at $1 each is $500.
They make 200 postings each with your name at number 2, which is 100,000
postings (500X200), which is 5,000 returns at $1 each, which is $5000
dollars!  AND FINALLY, 5000 PEOPLE MAKE 200 POSTING EACH WITH YOUR NAME
AT NUMBER 1.  YOU NOW GET A RETURN OF $50,000 BEFORE YOUR NAME DROPS OFF
THE LIST.  And that's if everyone makes 200 postings only, and if only 5
persons respond or an average response of 2.5 percent!!!

Look, it's only $5 and 5 stamps.  I am a college student and even I
could afford this.  One thing that you should keep in mind to get an
optimized return on your investment:

HONESTY.  This system will only work if you are honest and mail $1 to
each of the 5 addresses listed above.  When people reproduce your
letter, the only way that YOU will make money is if they mail you $1.
LET'S TRY TO HELP EACH OTHER OUT.  Also, it is imperative that you make
sure that the addresses on the letter that you redistribute over the net
are accurate.

I wish you the best of luck,
Dave

----------------FOR NETSCAPE 3.0 USERS----------------

Remember, the key is to distribute to as many people as you can (200
minimun).  If you have Netscape 3.0 and want to take the newsgroup
option, follow these instructions to automate the task of redistributing
your letters:

1)Go to Window on the menu bar and select News.  Click on any newsgroup
like normal, then click on TO NEWS.

2)  Leave the news group box like it is, and CHANGE the subject to
something that will get people's attention (I personally always avoid
those stupid "FAST CASH.  LOOKEY HERE" subjects so maybe you should use
something on a more personal level)

3)Tab once and you should be ready to type your letter.  Some say you
should type this whole word by word, except to insert your name at #5
and to remove #1 from the list, plus any other small changes you think
you need to make.  Make sure you keep the essense of the system exactly
as stated above.  If you are well versed with computers, you will be
able to work around retyping the whole thing word for word by
importing/exporting/cutting/pasting.  Regardless, you only need to
reconstruct the letter that you are going to distribute ONCE.

4)  When you are done typing the article, click on 'FILE' in THIS BOX,
RIGHT ABOVE 'SEND', NOT WHERE IT SAYS NETSCAPE NEWS ON THE FIRST BOX.
Click on SAVE AS when you're under FILE.  Save your article as a text
file (.txt) onto your C: or A: drive.  DO NOT SEND OR POST YOUR ARTICLE
UNTIL YOU DO THIS.  Once saved, proceed to #5 below.

5)  If you still have all of your text, send or post to this newsgroup
now by just clicking SEND.

6)  Here's where you are going to post all 200.  Click on any news group
then click on 'To News", again in the top left corner.  Leave the
NEWSGROUPS BOX alone again, change the subject title, hit TAB once so
you're in the body of the message, and click on ATTACHMENTS, which is
below the SUBJECT BOX.  You will get another box to come up.  Click on
ATTACH FILE, then find YOUR file that you saved;  click once on the
file, and then click OPEN;  now click OK.  If you did this right, you
should see your file name in the attachments box.

IF YOU USE INTERNET EXPLORER IT'S JUST AS EASY....USE THE FACT THAT
'CTRL' AND 'C' DEPRESSED AT THE SAME TIME COPIES AN ARTICLE ONTO THE
CLIPBOARD, AND 'CTRL' AND 'V' DEPRESSED AT THE SAME TIME PASTES THE
ARTICLE.  

7)  That's it.  Each time you do this, all you have to do is type in a
different newsgroup, so that way, it posts to 200 DIFFERENT newsgroups.
Now you just have 199 to go!!  Don't worry, each one takes less than 30
seconds once you get used to it.  REMEMBER 200 IS A MINIMUM.

A STORY ABOUT THAT MONEY MAKING THING YOU SEE ON THE INTERNET
__________________________________________________________________

Hi, it's me. I am really nobody.  I just want to tell you the story behind
this "$5.00 becomes $50.000.00" message you see on the internet everyday.  

I work for Disney getting $5.95 a hour.  My rent is $480.00 a month which
doesn't including water and gas.  Living in Florida also means A/C will
cost me a fortune.  I have a Cockatiel named Harriet that wakes me up every
morning while I try to sleep. She (I think it's he) needs food and that
costs me money.  The a/c in my car went out and that will need to be fixed.
  I had every reason to try this money making thing more than anybody else,
huh?

When I read these money making stories, I  had my doubts.  After all, it
was just too good to be true.  But I guess investing or losing just $5.00
on this thing was no big deall.  I have lost  great things in life and 
couldn't  justify moaning over a lousy five.  I went to Vegas last
November, and I lost  more than $500.00, but that's another story, maybe I
can share with you all next time.

So I did it.  I sent $1.00 to everyone on that list, and I rented a mail
box and waited for the money to come in.  It was almost one month before I
started to receive money.  It was not much, around  $50.00.  In four
months, I have received a total of $985.00.  Hey, it's not bad for someone
who only spent one afternoon posting messages to 250 different news groups.
 

I know a lot of messages you see on the internet say that you can make
$50,000.00 in 4 months. Well, I think the number maybe overly distorted. 
Who knows, I'm still seeing my returns..  Common sense says that's probably
not likely.  If so, Disney World wouldn't have any ride operators at "It's
a Small World" because he or she could make $40,00.00 in 4 months.  Why
works for Disney?

The idea behind this money making system is nothing new. Whoever thought
about this was probably a college economic professor.  Just like
Government, the reason why it has so much money is to get little bit from
everyone.  In this case, we are like government, we took $1.00 from
everyone, and everyone who sent $1.00 also gets a little from everyone who
sent them $1.00.  When money exchange circulating between hands, people who
stay in this system all benefit from it.

You may ask is this legal? Yes, the system is designed so it's legal.  If
it's not legal. Date Line on ABC or 20/20 would have already done a lead
story.  I must make a prediction here, I believe that our Government will
probably say something soon cause they won't able to tax the money we
receive, so far, they haven't been able to do anything.  

Oh, I must tell you that I felt guilty when I opened those envelopes with
money inside.  All that money for something without any effort.  Consider
this a thank you letter to all those who took a chance and sent me that
dollar.  There is no reason not to do it.  You'll be happy you did!!

NOW this is that famous letter you see on the internet everyday. Follow
these steps closely.  Make sure you send $1.00 to everyone on the list.



HEADER
The Internet has grown tremendously. It doubles in size every 4
months. Still, less than 5% of everyone on earth has access. Do
you understand the potential of what I am saying here???

STEP 1.
Invest your $5 by writing your name and address on five seperate
pieces of paper along with the words: "PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING
LIST." (In this way, you're not just sending a dollar to someone;
you're paying for a legitimate service.) and mail them by 
standard U. S. Mail to the following five addresses fold a $1 bill, money
order,
or bank note inside each:

1.  Bill Brown
    148 South Downlen #796
    Beaumont,TX  77707
    USA

2. FLI
    930 East Ellis Street #142
    Jefferson City,TN  37760
    USA

3. ISL
   2-308 Lamoine Village
   Macomb, IL 61455

4. K.LEE
   535 Hanover St.
   Daly City, CA 94014

5. HS Lee
   2652 31st St.
   Santa Monica, CA 90405
 

    Now here is how and why this system works:

    Out of every block of 250 posts I made, I got back 5 responses.
    Yes, thats right,only 5. You make $5.00 in cash, not checks or
    money orders, but real cash with your name at #5.

    Each additional person who sent you $1.00 now also makes 250
    additional postings with your name at #4, 1000 postings. On
    average then, 50 people will send you $1.00 with your name at
    #4,....$50.00 in your pocket!

    Now these 50 new people will make 250 postings each with your
    name at #3 or 10,000 postings. Average return, 500 people= $500.
    They make 250 postings each with your name at #2= 100,000
    postings=5000 returns at $1.00 each=$5,000.00 in cash!

    Finally, 5,000 people make 250 postings each with your name at
    #1 and you get a return of $60,000 before your name drops off
    the list.And that's only if everyone down the line makes only 250
    postings each! Your total income for this one cycle is $55,000.

    From time to time when you see your name is no longer on the list,
    you take the latest posting you can find and start all over again.

                The end result depends on you. You must follow through
                and repost this article everywhere you can think of.
                The more  postings you  make, the more cash ends up in
                your mailbox. It's too easy and too cheap to pass
                up!!!

    So thats it. Pretty simple sounding stuff, huh? But believe me, it
    works. There are millions of people surfing the net every day, all
    day, all over the world. And 100,000 new people get on the net
    every day. You know that, you've seen the stories in the paper.
    So, my friend, read and follow the simple instructions and play
    fair. Thats the key, and thats all there is to it. Print this out
    right now so you can refer back to this article easily. Try to
    keep an eye on all the postings you made to make sure everyone is
    playing fairly. You know where your name should be.

    If you're really not sure or still think this can't be
    for real, then don't do it. But please print this article and pass
    it along to someone you know who really needs the bucks, and see

    that of all the Internetusers very few have found the Usenet, most
    of them are still just surfing the web! I haven't made any

*** By the way, if you try to deceive people by posting the messages
with your name in the list and not sending the bucks to the people
already included, you will not get much. I know someone who did this
and only got about $150 (and that's after two months). Then he sent
the 5 bills, people added him to their lists, and in 4-5 weeks he had
over $10,000!

A STORY ABOUT THAT MONEY MAKING THING YOU SEE ON THE INTERNET
__________________________________________________________________

Hi, it's me. I am really nobody.  I just want to tell you the story behind
this "$5.00 becomes $50.000.00" message you see on the internet everyday.  

I work for Disney getting $5.95 a hour.  My rent is $480.00 a month which
doesn't including water and gas.  Living in Florida also means A/C will
cost me a fortune.  I have a Cockatiel named Harriet that wakes me up every
morning while I try to sleep. She (I think it's he) needs food and that
costs me money.  The a/c in my car went out and that will need to be fixed.
  I had every reason to try this money making thing more than anybody else,
huh?

When I read these money making stories, I  had my doubts.  After all, it
was just too good to be true.  But I guess investing or losing just $5.00
on this thing was no big deall.  I have lost  great things in life and 
couldn't  justify moaning over a lousy five.  I went to Vegas last
November, and I lost  more than $500.00, but that's another story, maybe I
can share with you all next time.

So I did it.  I sent $1.00 to everyone on that list, and I rented a mail
box and waited for the money to come in.  It was almost one month before I
started to receive money.  It was not much, around  $50.00.  In four
months, I have received a total of $985.00.  Hey, it's not bad for someone
who only spent one afternoon posting messages to 250 different news groups.
 

I know a lot of messages you see on the internet say that you can make
$50,000.00 in 4 months. Well, I think the number maybe overly distorted. 
Who knows, I'm still seeing my returns..  Common sense says that's probably
not likely.  If so, Disney World wouldn't have any ride operators at "It's
a Small World" because he or she could make $40,00.00 in 4 months.  Why
works for Disney?

The idea behind this money making system is nothing new. Whoever thought
about this was probably a college economic professor.  Just like
Government, the reason why it has so much money is to get little bit from
everyone.  In this case, we are like government, we took $1.00 from
everyone, and everyone who sent $1.00 also gets a little from everyone who
sent them $1.00.  When money exchange circulating between hands, people who
stay in this system all benefit from it.

You may ask is this legal? Yes, the system is designed so it's legal.  If
it's not legal. Date Line on ABC or 20/20 would have already done a lead
story.  I must make a prediction here, I believe that our Government will
probably say something soon cause they won't able to tax the money we
receive, so far, they haven't been able to do anything.  

Oh, I must tell you that I felt guilty when I opened those envelopes with
money inside.  All that money for something without any effort.  Consider
this a thank you letter to all those who took a chance and sent me that
dollar.  There is no reason not to do it.  You'll be happy you did!!

NOW this is that famous letter you see on the internet everyday. Follow
these steps closely.  Make sure you send $1.00 to everyone on the list.



HEADER
The Internet has grown tremendously. It doubles in size every 4
months. Still, less than 5% of everyone on earth has access. Do
you understand the potential of what I am saying here???

STEP 1.
Invest your $5 by writing your name and address on five seperate
pieces of paper along with the words: "PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING
LIST." (In this way, you're not just sending a dollar to someone;
you're paying for a legitimate service.) and mail them by 
standard U. S. Mail to the following five addresses fold a $1 bill, money
order,
or bank note inside each:

1.  Bill Brown
    148 South Downlen #796
    Beaumont,TX  77707
    USA

2. FLI
    930 East Ellis Street #142
    Jefferson City,TN  37760
    USA

3. Yoshitsugu Kikuchi
    6-19-9-403, Arakawa
    Arakawa-ku, Tokyo 116
    JAPAN

4. Billy Landenberger
      P.O. Box 509
      Accord, MA  02018
      USA

5. Cheryl Shih
    P.O. Box 22756
    Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830
    USA

    Now here is how and why this system works:

    Out of every block of 250 posts I made, I got back 5 responses.
    Yes, thats right,only 5. You make $5.00 in cash, not checks or
    money orders, but real cash with your name at #5.

    Each additional person who sent you $1.00 now also makes 250
    additional postings with your name at #4, 1000 postings. On
    average then, 50 people will send you $1.00 with your name at
    #4,....$50.00 in your pocket!

    Now these 50 new people will make 250 postings each with your
    name at #3 or 10,000 postings. Average return, 500 people= $500.
    They make 250 postings each with your name at #2= 100,000
    postings=5000 returns at $1.00 each=$5,000.00 in cash!

    Finally, 5,000 people make 250 postings each with your name at
    #1 and you get a return of $60,000 before your name drops off
    the list.And that's only if everyone down the line makes only 250
    postings each! Your total income for this one cycle is $55,000.

    From time to time when you see your name is no longer on the list,
    you take the latest posting you can find and start all over again.

                The end result depends on you. You must follow through
                and repost this article everywhere you can think of.
                The more  postings you  make, the more cash ends up in
                your mailbox. It's too easy and too cheap to pass
                up!!!

    So thats it. Pretty simple sounding stuff, huh? But believe me, it
    works. There are millions of people surfing the net every day, all
    day, all over the world. And 100,000 new people get on the net
    every day. You know that, you've seen the stories in the paper.
    So, my friend, read and follow the simple instructions and play
    fair. Thats the key, and thats all there is to it. Print this out
    right now so you can refer back to this article easily. Try to
    keep an eye on all the postings you made to make sure everyone is
    playing fairly. You know where your name should be.

    If you're really not sure or still think this can't be
    for real, then don't do it. But please print this article and pass
    it along to someone you know who really needs the bucks, and see
    what happens.

    In a way, this is too good to be true but here's the deal:
    This will only work as long as new people joins all the time,
    you don't have to be an Einstein to figure that out. But since
    you read this within a month of the posting you are one of the 5%
    in the world with Internet acces. That means that the Internet will
    keep growing at an increased rate for YEARS to come. And remember

I am working on a project that could involve some video work. I'd like
some information on taking video and inputing it into the Mac, in
QuickTime form or MPEG format. Does anyone know how to do this? Is there
a simple way to go about this. Any shareware software that handles this?
I would think that it would be done similar to recording sound, but I
can't find anything that allows me to do this. I've checked out Apple's
QT page, but there's nothing about how to actually make a movie, only
how to run it.

Bob

-Mr. Norris
I rarely reply to these news letters, but feel that I have to speak up 
this time and say that what you are doing is wrong and unethical.

Have you no pride?

I too went through the same you did, (like millions of other individuals 
across North America), but I have NEVER asked another person to bail me 
out of a situation that I got myself into. SCAM or no SCAM, if you're 
that bad off, bite the bullet, declare bankruptcy and get on with your 
life.

Been there, done that, got the T-shirt

	I too think that bankruptcy is the answer...its a good option at this
stage....could sell your PC first for food if necessary.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
 
 Hello!! How would you like to make thousands of dollars, quickly,legally,
 and with no catch? Then keep reading....
 
 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
 
 Please take 5 minutes to read this article: IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE, just
 like it did for mine. It's true! You can make up to or over $50,000 in 4 to
 6 weeks, maybe sooner!
 
 I personally have never believed in a so called Free Lunch  and have always
 worked hard to support my family. But this idea is so simple involving a
 modest $5.00 investment that I simply had to try it. With so many people
 involved I became convinced that I too could benefit. And, as I found out,
 this system really does work!
 
 Within 7 days, I started getting some response in the mail! I was shocked!!
 But pleasantly surprised. I still didn't believe thousands were on there
 way, and didn't give it another thought. But then the money kept coming in,
 tripling in size and multiplying by 10 to 20 times the amount I got in the
 first week!! In the first week I recieved about $25, but after the second
 week, I had a total near $1000!! In the third week I received just short of
 $10,000, and everday there would litteraly be a bundle of letters! This is
 the start of my fifth week and at total I have made over $63,986
 (yesterday's grand total so far) and the letters are still coming! And I'm
 starting again.
 
 If you 're interested there are three basic steps, all of which are pretty
 simple.
 
 Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, WHY IT WORKS....also,
 make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the
 information off of it, and begin earning money today!
 
 The process is very simple, and it consists of just 3 easy steps:
 
 
 $$$$$$ THE FIRST STEP (1)
 
 Get 5 seperate pieces of paper and write the following words on each piece
 of paper..."Please add me to your mailing list, your name was in position 1
 " Then write your name and address on the piece of paper. Now repeat the
 process with the other four pieces of paper, except of course you will
 write "your name was in position 2" on the second piece, and "your name was
 in position 3" on the third piece...you get it. Now place each piece of
 paper around a $1 bill and place inside of the envelopes. You should now
 have five envelopes, with one dollar in each, wrapped in a piece of paper
 that says "please add me to your mailing list"(you will be added to a
 mailing list, that's what makes it legal) Make sure that the position
 number matches the position of the person that you are mailing to. Thats
 how they will tell the progress of this article. Now mail the envelopes to
 the following 5 addresses:
 
 1)     G. Arrigo
        P.O. BOX
        8952 Schlieren
        Switzerland
 
 2)     S. Hines
        9804 Kingsman
        Dallas, TX 75228
 
 3)     A. LEBLANC
        C.P. 764
        Vercheres Qc, J0L 2R0
        Canada
        
4)        D. Downs
           146 Woodborough Way
            Edmonton AB, T5Y1N2
            Canada
 
 5)	A.Warner
	23 Blake Lane, Apt D ('D' for David)
	Scotts Valley, CA95066
	USA
 
 $$$$$ THE SECOND STEP (2)
 
 Now take the name #1 off the list that you see above, move the other four
 names up the list (2 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2,ect..), and put your name and
 address in position 5.
 
 
 $$$$$ THE THIRD STEP (3)
 
 Now rewrite this article to tell your own story (you may be able to save
 this one and edit it instead) and be sure to put your name in position 5
 and move up the others, and post it in at least 250 newsgroups. The more
 the exposure, the more responses you will get. All you need is a good
 foundation of returns.
 
 *************************************************************************
 AND THAT'S IT!!! THAT'S THE ONLY THREE STEPS INVOLVED!!!
 *************************************************************************
 
 You are now in the mail order business and will now start recieving your $1
 envelopes from people all over within a few days!

 HINT: THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST TO -> THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE.
 
 LET ME TELL YOU WHY THIS PROGRAM WORKS AND WHAT IS ITS POTENTIAL.
 
 Out of every 200 postings lets say you receive only 5 responses, which is
 very low. So you made $5 with your name in position #5. Now then, lets say
 that each of those people make 200 postings for themseves. Now your name is
 posted 1000 times in position 4, and still out there in position 5, and you
 now make $50. Now what's 50 times 200. So for position 3 your name is out
 there 10,000 times. If the trend continues, you name will be posted about
 250,000- 1.000.000 times. You can easily see how you can make fast cash 
 with only 5 respones for each 200 postings.
 
 THE POTENTIALIS FANTASTIC!!!
 
 When your name no longer appears on the list, you just take the latest
 posting that is in the latest newsgroups, and send out another $5 to the
 names on the list and start again.(like I'm doing right now)
 
 People have asked,"What if the plan is played out and no one sends you
 money, then what" All I say is "So what? It's only $5" What are the chances
 of that happening when there are thousands of newsgroups, and tons of new
 honest users and people joining the internet each day and are willing to
 give it a try?!? Estimates are between 20,000 and 50,000 new users every
 day. Remember, play FAIR and HONEST, and THIS WILL WORK. I PROMISE YOU! You
 have to be patient. Make sure you print this out right now! Also keep a
 list of everyone who sends you money, you may be able to sell the list to
 businesses when you have enough. Also keep an eye on the newsgroups and
 keep everyone playing fair! You do not have to cheat to make your money!
 GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE, PLAY FAIR, AND YOU WILL REAP HUGE REWARDS!!!

I sent $1 to each of the following names on Jan. 6, 1997. The entire
article is included.
DO YOU NEED MONEY... AND NEED IT NOW!!

THIS IS THE FASTEST... AND FAIREST... WAY I KNOW TO SHARE THE WEALTH!

Would you like to make thousands of dollars quickly, legally, and with 
NO CATCH? 

Then keep reading...please take five minutes to read this article in 
its entirety...it will change your life. It has certainly changed mine! 
You can make up to, or over, $50,000 in only 4-6 weeks. I know, it 
sounds like a scam, BUT IT'S NOT A SCAM... READ ON! Really, if you're 
interested, keep reading; if you're not, please don't let me waste any 
more of your time.
        OK, still with me? A little while back, I was browsing through 
these newsgroups, just like you are now, and I came across an article 
similar to this that said you could make thousands of dollars in only 
weeks with an initial investment of ONLY $5! And, like you, I thought 
"Yeah, right, must be a scam..." But, I was intrigued...like most of us 
are...and so I kept reading. Anyway, the article said that you were to 
send $1.00 to each of the 5 names and addresses listed in the article. 
You then placed your own name and address and the article in at least 
250 newsgroups...there are thousands!...no catch...that was all you had 
to do.
        So after thinking it over and talking to a few friends first, I 
decided to try it...after all, if it really was a scam all I would 
loose would be my $5 and the cost of 5 stamps, right?  Well, guess what 
... within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail...No kidding!  I 
have to tell you, I was surprised to say the least. I still figured it 
would end soon and didn't give it too much thought. But then money kept 
coming in...tripling in numbers and multiplying by 10 and 20 times the 
amount that I got the first week! In my first week I made about $20 or 
$30. But by the end of the second week, I had made a total of over 
$1,000!!  In the third week, I had over $10,000, and it's still 
growing. This is my fourth week and I've made about
$42,000 TOTAL .. and the money is still coming in.
        Let me tell you how this works and more importantly, WHY it 
works...also, make sure you print a copy of the article so you get the 
information from it and can begin making money yourself.  The process is 
very simple and it consists of just 3 EASY steps:
        
        STEP 1:  Get 5 separate pieces of paper and write the following 
statement on each sheet of paper..."PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.
YOU ARE 
NUMBER ___ " ( To do this,you paid for the service and made an
investment. Receiving a service makes it legal.Then all people who check
the
newsgroups will trust you and it makes your investment work in the
net.) Get five $1.00 bills and place ONE inside each piece
of paper that you just wrote on and fold the piece of paper so the bill 
will not be seen in the envelope (otherwise, nosey people who like to 
steal mail with money in it will get yours!) Put one folded note (with 
your $1.00 bill) inside the envelope and seal it. Do the same for each 
of the five names.  Be sure to send a dollar, or you will be creating
bad
karma that will come back to haunt you for years to come. You should now
have 5 envelopes sealed, EACH envelope has a piece of paper with the
message asking to be put on the mailing list and a $1.00 bill hidden
inside the paper, right?  This is IMPORTANT... Make sure you have
written
the message on each sheet of 
paper .. by doing this you are creating a service and keeping 
everything PERFECTLY LEGAL .. Now, mail the 5 envelopes to each of the 
5 addresses listed
below:

1.  J. Johnson, 6930 Oak Vally Lane, Colorado Springs, CO 80919
2.  J. Sain, P.O. Box 968, Hildebran, NC 28637
3.  J. Marini, 1283 W. San Jose, Fresno, CA 93711
4.  Jun Zhou, 1132 W.Blaine St. #102, Riverside,CA 92507
5.  G. L. Shaw, 325 E. 2550 North #91, Ogden, Utah  84414

STEP 2:  Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the 
other 4 names up (5 becoming 4, 4 becoming 3, etc.) and put YOUR NAME 
as number 5 on the list.  You can slightly alter this article if you 
need to, editing what you feel you need to edit.

STEP 3:  Post your amended article ... with your name as #5 ... to at 
least 250 newsgroups (I'm told that there are close to 18,000 of them!) 
and all you need is 250 or so, of them.

HOW TO DO THIS -- If you have Netscape 3.0 do EXACTLY the following: 
        A) Click on any newsgroup like you were going to look at it, 
then click on "TO NEWS" which is on the far left when you're in the 
newsgroup page. This will bring up a box to type a message. 
        B) Leave the newsgroup box like it is. CHANGE the Subject Box 
to something flashy like ... "NEED CASH $$$ READ HERE $$$" ... or ... 
"FAST CASH!!"
        C) Tab once and you should be ready to type. Now, retype (only 
once) this entire article .. WORD FOR WORD .. except to insert your 
name at #5 and to remove #1 off the list, plus any other small changes 
you think you need to make. Keep almost all of it the same however!
        D) When you're finished typing the entire article, click on 
FILE in
THIS box (just above the SEND button ... NOT where it says NETSCAPE 
NEWS on the first box) Now click on SAVE AS in the dropdown menu. Save 
your article as a text file to your C: or A: drive. DO NOT SEND OR POST 
YOUR ARTICLE UNTIL YOU HAVE SAVED IT!  Once saved, move on to Step E 
below.
        E) If you still have all of your text, send or post to this 
newsgroup now by 
just clicking the SEND button (just below the FILE dropdown menu and 
just above the C: button)
        F) Here's where you're going to post to 250 or more, newsgroups 
... OK.... click on any newsgroup then click on "TO NEWS" ... again, in 
the top left corner of your screen. Leave the NEWSGROUPS BOX alone 
again, put a flashy subject title in the SUBJECT BOX, hit TAB once and 
you're in the body of the message. Now click on the ATTACHMENT button 
(just below the Subject Line) Another window will come up...click on 
ATTACH  FILE .. now find the file that you just saved in the previous 
procedure.  Click ONCE on the file and then click OPEN  and then OK. If 
you did this correctly you should now see your file name in the 
Attachments Box and it will be highlighted.

IF YOU USE IE EXPLORER it's just as easy ... Holding down the left 
mouse button, highlight this article. Then press the "CTRL" key and the 
"C" key at the same time to copy the article. Then print the article 
for your records to have the names of those you will be sending the 
$1.00 bills to. Next, go to the newsgropus and press "POST AN ARTICLE". 
A window will open ... type in your headline in the SUBJECT area and 
then click in the large window below. Press "CTRL" and then "V" and the 
article will be placed inthe window. If you want to edit the article 
you can do so and then highlight and copy it again (so your edited 
article will be copied again and again to each newsgroup) Now, 
everytime you post the article in a new newsgroup all you have to 
repeat is "CTRL" and "V" and press POST.

        G) That's it! Each time you do this, all you have to do is type 
in a different newsgroup so you can post this message to 250 or more, 
DIFFERENT, newsgroups. I know, I know, ... you've still got 249 to go! 
Don't worry, each successive article will only take about 30 SECONDS 
once you get the hang of it. Remember, 250 is the MINIMUM .. the more 
you post, the more money you will make!

That's it ... THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT ... JUST THREE EASY STEPS!!!

You are now in the mail order business and will start receiving your $1 
envelopes from various people all over the world within days. REMEMBER 
.... the more newsgroups you post to, the more money you will make! You 
may want to rent a P.O. Box eventually because of all the mail. If you 
wish to stay anonymous, you can come up with a name, such as "manager" 
or "investor" ... just make sure all the addresses are CORRECT please.

Now ... let me tell you WHY this system works ...

Out of every 250 postings, let's say I only receive 5 replies .. 
doesn't seem like much 
does it? However, you will make $5 cash .. not checks or money orders 
but CASH ... with your name at #5.

Each additional person who sent you $1 now also makes 250 additional 
postings with your name at #4 ... this is 1000 postings. On average 
then, 50 people should send you $1 with your name at #4 ... that's $50 
CASH in your pocket!

Now these 50 new people will make 250 postings each with your name at 
#3.... that's 10,000 postings! Average return would be 500 people ... 
that's $500.
Each of these people make 250 postings now with your name at #2 ... 
that's 100,000 postings ... average 5,000 returns at $1 each is $5,000!

Finally, 5,000 people make 250 postings each with your name at #1 and 
you get a return of $60,000 before your name drops off the list! And 
that's only if everyone down the line makes only 250 postings each ... 
REMEMBER ... the more postings you make, the more money you make!

When your name is no longer on the list, you can just take the latest 
posting that is appearing in the newsgroups and send out another $5 to 
the names on the current list, putting your name at #5 and start 
posting again. The thing to remember is this...thousands and thousands 
of people all over the world are joining the Internet and reading these 
articles every day ... just like you are right now?!! So can you afford 
NOT to send out your $5 just to see if it works?! I think NOT!
        
People have said, "What if the plan is played out and no one sends you
the money?" So what! What are the chances of that happening when there 
are TONS of NEW honest users and NEW honest people who are joining the 
Internet and newsgroups every day and are willing to give it a try? 
Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, EVERYDAY, with thousands 
of those joining the actual Internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and 
HONESTLY and this WILL WORK .. I promise you. You just have to be 
honest. Make sure you print this article out 
right now... also... try to keep a list of everyone that sends you 
money and always keep an eye on the newsgroups to make sure everyone is 
playing fairly. REMEMBER ... HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY .. YOU DON'T 
NEED TO CHEAT THE BASIC IDEA TO MAKE MONEY!! Good luck to all and 
please play fairly and you will reap hugh rewards from this!
        
By the way, if you try to decieve people by posting the messages with 
your name on the list and not sending the money to the people already 
on the list, YOU WILL NOT GET MUCH RETURN! Someone I talked to knew 
someone who did just that and he only made $150 after 7 or 8 weeks!! 
Then he sent the 5 $1.00 bills out .. people added him to their lists 
... and in 4-5 weeks he had OVER $10,000!

THIS IS THE FAIREST AND MOST HONEST WAY I HAVE EVER SEEN TO SHARE THE 
WEALTH OF THE WORLD WITHOUT COSTING ANYTHING BUT FIVE DOLLARS AND A
LITTLE
OF YOUR TIME! DO IT LIKE IT'S LAID OUT HERE ... 

IT WILL WORK!!
IT SHOULD WORK!!

Take five minutes to read this and it WILL change your life.

The Internet has grown tremendously. It doubles in size every 4
months.
Think about it. You see those 'Make.Money.Fast' posts more and more.
That's ... because it WORKS !  So I thought, all those new users might
make it work. And I decided to try it out, a few months ago. Besides,
whats $5.00, I spend more than that in the morning on my way to work
on coffee and cigs for the day. So I sent in my money and
posted.Everyone was
calling it a scam, but there are SO many new users from AOL, N

Well, two weeks later, I began recieving bucks in the mail!  I
couldn't believe it! Not just a little, I mean big bucks!  At first
only a
few hundred dollars, then a week later, a couple of thousand, the
By the end of the fourth week, I had recieved nearly $47,000.00. It
came
from all over the world. And every bit of it perfectly legal and on
the up and up. I've been able to pay off all my bills and still had
enough left over for a nice vacation for me and my family.

Not only does it work for me, it works for other folks as well. Markus
Valppu says he made $57,883 in four weeks. Dave Manning claims he
made $53,664 in the same amount of time. Dan Shepstone says it was
only
$17,000 for him. Do I know these folks? No, but when I read how they
say
they did it, it made sense to me. Enough sense that I'm taking this
serious.


STEP 1.

Invest your $5 by writing your name and address on five seperate
pieces of paper along with the words: "PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING
LIST."
(In this way, you're not just sending a dollar to someone; you're
paying
for a legitimate service.) Fold a $1 bill inside each paper, and mail
them
to the following adresses:

1-T.Toole box1138,Valemount B.C
    Canada VOE-2ZO

2-Vitor Schlrder de Borba
    Av Lucas de olivieira 2280 ap 404
    90460-000 Porto Alegre/RS Brasil

3-Evert jan Benz
    nijensteinheerd 58
    9736 TD  Groningen
    Netherlands

4-Patrick Delage
     14 Rolland
     Ibville,Qc,Canada
     J2X 4J3

5-Chris Thompson
     100 Bunnie Trail
     Ellenwood, GA 30049
     USA

STEP 2.

    Now remove the top name from the list, and move the
    other names up.This way, #5 becomes #4 and so on.
    Put your name in as the fifth one on the list.


STEP 3.

    Post the article to at least 250 newsgroups. There are at
    least 19000 newsgroups at any given moment in time.
    Try posting to as many newsgroups as you can. Remember
    the more groups you post to, the more people will see your
    article and send you cash!


STEP 4.

    You are now in business for yourself, and should start seeing
    returns within 7 to 14 days! Remember, the Internet is new
    and huge. There is no way you can lose.

    Now here is how and why this system works:

    Out of every block of 250 posts I made, I got back 5 responses.
    Yes, thats right,only 5. You make $5.00 in cash, not checks or
    money orders, but real cash with your name at #5.

    Each additional person who sent you $1.00 now also makes 250
    additional postings with your name at #4, 1000 postings. On
    average then, 50 people will send you $1.00 with your name at
    #4,....$50.00 in your pocket!

    Now these 50 new people will make 250 postings each with your
    name at #3 or 10,000 postings. Average return, 500 people= $500.
    They make 250 postings each with your name at #2= 100,000
    postings=5000 returns at $1.00 each=$5,000.00 in cash!

    Finally, 5,000 people make 250 postings each with your name at
    #1 and you get a return of $60,000 before your name drops off
    the list.And that's only if everyone down the line makes only 250
    postings each! Your total income for this one cycle is $55,000.

    From time to time when you see your name is no longer on the list,
    you take the latest posting you can find and start all over again.

                The end result depends on you. You must follow through
                and repost this article everywhere you can think of.
                The more  postings you  make, the more cash ends up in
                your mailbox. It's too easy and too cheap to pass
up!!!

    So thats it. Pretty simple sounding stuff, huh? But believe me, it
    works. There are millions of people surfing the net every day, all
    day, all over the world. And 100,000 new people get on the net
    every day. You know that, you've seen the stories in the paper.
    So, my friend, read and follow the simple instructions and play
    fair. Thats the key, and thats all there is to it. Print this out
    right now so you can refer back to this article easily. Try to
keep
    an eye on all the postings you made to make sure everyone is
    playing fairly. You know where your name should be.

    If you're really not sure or still think this can't be
    for real, then don't do it. But please print this article and pass
    it along to someone you know who really needs the bucks, and see
    what happens.

    REMEMBER....HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.YOU DON'T
    NEED TO CHEAT THE BASIC IDEA TO MAKE THE BUCKS!
    GOOD LUCK TO ALL, AND PLEASE PLAY FAIR AND YOU WILL
    WIN AND MAKE SOME REAL INSTANT FREE CASH!

*** By the way, if you try to deceive people by posting the messages
with your name in the list and not sending the bucks to the people
already included, you will not get much. I know someone who did this
and only got about $150 (and that's after two months). Then he sent
the 5 bills, people added him to their lists, and in 4-5 weeks he had
over $10,000!

                TRY IT AND YOU'LL BE HAPPY!!!  :o) !!!!!!!!!!

Whenever I come upon this type of ad, by the time I get through all the
hype, I'm turned off to whatever it is that the seemingly HYPER person
posting the ad is attempting to peddle.

I'm a man of few words, and I'm an honest guy who will not insult your
intelligence by telling you that I've received untold thousands in the
mail! In fact, I haven't received a dime as yet, and I haven't yet sent
my $5 investment!  My 5 envelopes are stuffed and will be mailed Tuesday
2/18.

I can tell you THIS, however, the internet is growing at an alarming
rate (doubles in size every 4 months!)and it only stands to reason that
if out of the millions of people who access this posting there are a few
thousand honest, trusting souls with a dream who can see clear to invest
a little time and the ONE TIME small amount of $5 it's worth giving it a
try.


THIS IS PERFECTLY LEGAL..NOT A CHAIN LETTER.  YOU ARE PAYING EACH OF THE
5 PEOPLE ON YOUR MAILING LIST $1, AND ASKING THEM TO PUT YOU ON THEIR
MAILING LIST. YOU ARE LEGALLY PAYING FOR A SERVICE.

THE PROCEDURE IS SIMPLE:

1)	Start by writing you name and address along with the message "PLEASE
ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST" on each of 5 sheets of paper.

2)	Fold the papers and put them into envelopes along with a $1 bill in
each. 

3)	Mail them to the following 5 addresses:

		1)	Mr.Carlo Gagliardi
			122 Charles Street
			Apt. 506
			Meriden,  CT  06450


		2)	Mr. Carson Jones
			3173 Stardust St.
			Rocklin,   CA 95677

		
		3)	Mr. James Saul
			29 Eugene Street
			Melville, NY  11747


		4)	Mrs. Rose Cusanelli
			9436 Glen Moor Lane
			Port Richey,  FL  34668


		5)	Mr. Steve Adamo
			16 Dublin Street
			Deposit,  NY  13754


4)	After mailing the envelopes, go back to this posting and remove the
top name from the list and move the other four up (#5 becomes #4 and so
on).  Put your name and address into #5 place on the list.  You can do
this by simply retyping this article, highlighting the whole thing
choose COPY from the EDIT menu and PASTE it into a text editor such as
NOTEPAD and save it.

5)PASTE the text into the message section of the message composition
window and SEND it to a newsgroup.


If you need any assistance with anything email me at
la16@ix.netcom.com..I'll be more than happy to help.  After all, I'm on
that list, and the more postings you do, the more $$ you make for BOTH
of us!!   GOOD LUCK!

Alan, thanks for the info on your business.  
I will look it over and get back to you.  
As for your Destiny posting, I think you overlooked something.  
In the media, you are "guilty until proven innocent".  The false 
reporting of Destiny being a scam was the work of a fired employee.  
He was able to do a lot of damage and cause problems for the 
hundreds of thousands of customers of Destiny.  I think anytime we 
use the media--yes, we can all be reporters now--thanks to the internet, 
we have an obligation to show both sides of the news.  Otherwise, 
we give up our integrity.
Your points on spotting a legit MLM were good.  They define Destiny 
exactly. 
Take a look.

1.  The difference between a pyramid scheme and a multilevel marketing 
plan is that the latter must involve the retail sale of a product which 
consumers can buy without also joining the marketing scheme.
Destiny markets many products and services.  It's most popular is the 
collectible phone card.  You can buy any of Destiny's products without 
ever selling for them. 

2.  Take time to consider your investment before signing anything or 
giving someone your money.
Destiny reps SCREEN people before ALLOWING them to become reps.  That is 
only common sense.  Who wants a downline of people who are not helping the 
company grow?

3.  Ask questions about the company and its officers, the products, their 
cost, fair market value, source of supply and the potential market in your 
area.
Any Destiny rep will give DETAILED info on the company.

4.  Ask about start up fees, required purchases and about the company's 
policy on the buy-back of required purchases.
You can get in Destiny for $100.00, you are not required to buy anything, 
ever. You get a 5 hour phone card for the $100.00 and you have 30 days to 
change your mind.

5.  Inquire about the average earnings of active distributors.
Destiny has LIVE CONFERENCE call Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, and Thur nights from 
9:55 to 10:30, Eastern.  1-916-689-8915 or 1-916-689-9090.  You can hear 
from reps all over the nation.

6.  Get written copies of all available company literature.
Destiny gives out reams of it.

7.  Consult with others who have had experience with the company and its 
products.
Call 1-770-592-3303, leave your name, number and a time to call.  
I will send you all the info you want on Destiny.

8.  Check to see if the products are actually being sold to consumers.
Destiny has over a half million reps and will have over a million before 
the year is up.  Millions will buy Destiny products and services 
this year alone.

9.  Try to determine whether these would be a market for the product if 
the multi-level marketing structure did not exist.
There already was, and still is a market for collectible phone cards and 
long distance services.

10.  Verify all information; do not assume that official looking documents 
are either accurate or complete.
Destiny reps are the most ethical sales people I have ever met.  Come to 
the Waverly Hotel in Atlanta on March 15, 1997 and meet a lot of them.

If you really think you are innocent until proven guilty Alan, what if I 
decide I do not want you to be a competitor?  What if I told the DA your 
business was a scam and they raided you.  What if I posted bad news-that 
was false-about your business all over the internet.  You would still be 
innocent, but your business would still suffer damage, and your efforts to 
prosecute me would not repair it much would it?  That is the power of 
false claims and negative reporting.  
I appreciate that your intention was to alert people, but I think a man of 
integrity also has a duty to follow up with the truth.

THIS IS THE FAIREST, MOST HONEST WAY I KNOW OF T0 SHARE THE WEALTH !!


             Hello! Would you like to make thousands of dollars
quickly, LEGALLY, with NO CATCH? Then keep reading. Please take a few
minutes to read this arcticle. It WILL change  your life, just like it
did mine. It's true! You can make up to or over  $50,000 in just 4-6
weeks, maybe sooner. I SWEAR THIS IS NOT A SCAM, AND I'M NOT LYING TO
YOU!! If you're interested, please read this arcticle  in it's
entirety. If you're not interested,  then I apologize for wasting your
time. But this could actually change your life.

        Here we go. A little while back, I was browsing these 
newsgroups, just
as you are now, and came across an arcticle similar to this that said
you could make thousands of dollars within weeks with an initial
investment of only $15.  I thought " yeah, right. Must be a scam",
like most of us. But I was also curious like most of us, so I kept
reading. It said that you send $3 to each of the 5 names listed below.
You then place your own name and address at the bottom of the list at
# 5, and post the arcticle in at least 200 newsgroups. (THERE IS
UPWARDS OF 30,000)

        No catch, that was it. So after thinking it over, and talking to 
a few
friends first, I thought about trying it . I figured; all I have to
loose is $15 and 5 stamps, right? Like most of us I was a little
skeptical, and a little worried,  about the legal ramifications of it
all. So I checked it out with the US Postal Service (1-800-725-2161)
and they confirmed that it was indeed legal, and the man  I spoke to
asked me to e-mail him a copy of the arcticle!!! I then invested the
$15. Well GUESS WHAT!... within 7 days, I started getting money in the
mail! I was shocked. I figured it would end soon, and didn't give it
another thought. But the money just kept coming in. In my first week,
I made about 20 to 30 dollars. By the end of the second week I made a
total of over $1000!!! In the third week I had over $10,000 and its
still growing. This is now the fourth week and I have made just over
$42,000!! And its still coming in. It is certainly worth the $15.

        Let me tell you how this works, and most importantly, WHY it 
works...
also, make sure you print a copy of this now, so you can get the info
off it as you need it. The process is very simple, and consists of 3
easy steps:
        STEP 1;  get 5 sheets of paper and write the following on each 
one
"PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now get 15  $1 bills, and put $3
inside EACH of the 5 pieces of paper so the bills will not be seen
through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one paper
inside each of the 5 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 5
sealed envelopes,  each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase
and 3 $1 bills. What you are doing is creating a service by this. THIS
IS PERFECTLY LEGAL!

        Now mail the 5 envelopes to the following addresses:

        1: Mike Frech 1203 Payne Ave, Edwards, CA 93523-1819

        2: Martin Poulin 4283 Brebouf st., #1, Montreal, Quebec, Canada 
H2J 3K6 

        3: Andre Sergeev 350079 Sormovskaja st. #28/15 Krasnodor Russia

        
        4: Noland Jack  102-15 Ontario St. S.,  Alliston, ON. L9R 1H9

        5: Brian Plopa  8163 Southwestern Blvd. #244  Dallas, Tx.  75206

        STEP 2: Now take the number 1 name off of the list that you see 
,
move the other 4 names up. . (5 becomes 4,  4 becomes 3 etc.)  Add
YOU"RE name as #5 on the list.

        STEP 3: Change anything you will need to, but try to keep this
arcticle as close to the original as possible. Now post your amended
arcticle to at least 200 newsgroups. (there are over 32,000)
 All you need is 200, but remember, the MORE you post, the more money
you make! Don't know how to post in the newsgroups? Well do EXACTLY
the following:

        FOR NETSCAPE USERS:

        1)  Click on any newsgroup, like normal. Then click on 'To 
News',
which is in the top left corner of the newsgroups page.
        This will bring up a message box.
        2) Fill in the subject with a FLASHY title, like the one I used,
something to catch the eye!!
        3) Now, go to the message part of the box and retype this letter
exactly as it is here, with the exeption of your few changes.
(remember to add your name to #5, and move the rest up)
        4) When you're done typing the whole letter, click on 'file', 
above
the send button. Then, 'save as'. Do not send your arcticle until you
have saved it. (so you dont have to type this 200 times).
        5) Now that you have saved your letter, go ahead and send your 
first
copy! Click that send button in the top left corner.
        6) THIS IS WHERE YOU POST ALL 200! Ok, go to any newsgroup 
arcticle
and click the 'to news' button again. Type in your flashy subject in
the subject box, then go to the body part of the message and place
your cursor here. NOW click on 'attachment' (which is right below the
SUBJECT BOX), click on attach file, then find your letter wherever you
saved it. Click once on your file and then click 'open' then click
'OK'. If you did this right,  you should see your file name in the
attachment box, and should be shaded green. NOW POST AWAY!!!


        IF YOU'RE USING INTERNET EXPLORER:

        It's just as easy Holding down the left mouse button, highlight 
this
entire arcticle, then press the 'CTRL' key and 'C' key at the same
time to copy this arcticle. Then, print the arcticle for your own
records to have the names of those you will be sending $3 to. NEXT, go
to the newsgroups and press 'POST AN ARCTICLE'. Type in your fancy
subject and click the large window below. Press 'CTRL' and 'V' and the
article will appear in the message window. **BE SURE TO MAKE YOUR
ADDRESS CHANGE TO THE 5 NAMES**
        Now, re-highlight the article and re-copy it so you have the
changes..then all you have to do for each newsgroup is 'CTRL' and 'V'
and press 'POST'. It's that EASY!
THAT'S IT, all you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and POST
AWAY. Once you get the hang of it, it takes about 30 seconds for each
newsgroup.  **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE
MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!!! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200**

        Thats it . You will begin recieving money from around the world 
within
days!  You may eventually want to rent a PO Box due to the large
amount of mail you recieve. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can
invent a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST
MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT**

        Now the WHY part: Out of 200 postings, say I recieve only 5 
replies.
(a very low example) So then I made $15 with my name at #5 on the
letter. Now, each of these 5 people who just sent me $3 make the
minimum 200 postings, each with my name at #4, and only 5 people
respond to each of the original 5, that is another $75 for me. Now
those 25 each make the minimum 200 postings with my name at #3 and
only recieve 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $475. NOW,
those 125 people post the minimum 200  with my name at #2 and only
recieve 5 replies each, I will make an additional $1875!! Ok, now here
is the fun part:  Each of those 625 persons post a minimum of 200
letters with my name at #1 on the list,  and they only recieve 5
replies each, that just made me $9375!!
        With an original investment of only $15, and a very low reply 
example
of 5, (the average is likely around 25) the total is $11,815!!!

        When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the 
latest
posting that is appearing in the newsgroups, and  do it all over
again.
        The thing to remember is, do you realize that
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE JOINING THE INTERNET AND
READING THESE ARTICLES EVERYDAY, JUST LIKE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW!!!
 So can you affford $15 dollars and see if it really works?  I think
so....

People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no one sends you
the money?  So what!  What are the chances of that happening when
there are
 TONS OF NEW HONEST USERS AND NEW HONEST PEOPLE who are joining the
Internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try?

Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, everyday, with
THOUSANDS of those joining the actual Internet.  Remember, play FAIRLY
and HONESTLY and this WILL WORK, I PROMISE YOU!!!!
You just have to be honest.  Make sure you print this article out
RIGHT NOW, also.  Try to keep a list of everyone that sends you money
and always keep an eye on the newsgroups to make sure everyone is
playing fairly.

REMEMBER, HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.  YOU DON'T NEED TO  CHEAT THE
BASIC IDEA TO MAKE THE MONEY!!!!  GOOD LUCK TO ALL AND PLEASE PLAY
FAIRLY AND YOU WILL REAP THE HUGE REWARDS FROM THIS, WHICH IS TONS OF
EXTRA CASH.

**by the way, if you try to deceive people by posting the messages
with your name in the list and not sending the money to the people
already on the list, you will not get as much.  Someone I talked to
knew someone who did that and he only made about $500 dollars, and
that's AFTER seven or eight weeks!  Then he sent the 5 $3 bills,
people added him to their lists, and in 4-5 weeks, he had over $10K.

THIS IS THE FAIREST AND MOST HONEST WAY I HAVE EVER SEEN TO SHARE THE
WEALTH OF THE WORLD WITHOUT COSTING ANYTHING BUT OUR TIME!!!!  You
also may want to buy mailing and email lists for future$$$.  Please

There is a marvellous island in the Mediterranean: it is called
Sardinia, a land with six thousand years of history, a wonderful sea,
gentle winds, fine wines and fabulous traditional food. If would like
to take a look please see below a list of Web addresses

For those who are prepared to spend at least six months of the year on
the island, carrying out their work via the Internet, it will be
possible to enjoy free connection to the Internet, along with
exemption from taxes and the chance to have a place to live, at little
or no cost, in the countryside or in a village a few kilometres from
the sea.

Hundreds of companies and individuals in the fields of computers,
journalism, science, research (or any other profession which can be
carried out throught the Internet) have already expressed their
interest, and have decided to come.

If you are interested, please send an e-mail to the following address.
nuovomovimento@scano20.vol.it

We would be very grateful if you could forward this message to anyone
else you think may be interested.

Many thanks for your attention.

The office of the New Movement

P.S. We would like to remind you that major research bodies such as
CRS4, directed by the Nobel Prize winning Carlo Rubbia, (who is also
director of the CERN the place where the Web was born), are already
operating in Sardinia. In Sardinia was also founded  Video On Line  by
Nicola Grauso.
Grauso is also the creator of a foundation which is in  strict
relationship with the most important research centers in technology
and social-politics. In Sardinia were also established the operative
office of the largest italian Internet provider, owned by Telecom
Italia.

N.B. If you would like to take a closer look of Sardinia please open

$$$ NOT A SCAM. PLEASE READ.$$$ (Ed Plant , 11/07/97 07:12)

Yes, I know it's spam, but just consider this before you hit the delete
button:  If you follow this plan and ONLY SIX PEOPLE respond, you'll
break even.  So what have you got to lose???
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY FAST???
Of course you do, we all do !!! Here's how to do so with little effort,
and, yes IT'S LEGAL.
A little while back, I was browsing these newsgroups, just like you
are now, and came across an article similar to this that said you could
make thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment
of
$6.00! So I thought, "Yeah, right, this must be a scam!", but like most
of
us, I was curious. Like most of us, I kept reading. Anyway, it said that
if
you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and addresses stated in the
article,
you could make thousands in a very short period of time.  You then place
your
own name and address at the bottom of the list at #6, and post the
article
to
at least 200 newsgroups.(There are about 22,000.)
No catch, that was it.
Even though the investment was a measely $6, I had three questions that
needed to be answered before I could get involved in this sort of thing.
1. IS THIS REALLY LEGAL??
I called a lawyer first.  The lawyer was a little skeptical that I would
actually make any money but he said it WAS LEGAL if I wanted to try it.
I
told him it sounded a lot like a chain letter but the details of the
system (SEE BELOW) actually made it a legitimate legal business.
2. Would the Post Office be ok with this....I called them:
1-800-725-2161
and they confirmed THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! (See Title 18,h sections
1302
NS 1341 of Postal Lottery Laws). This clarifies the program of
collecting
names and addresses for a mailing list.
3. Is this moral?  Well, everyone who sends me a buck has a good chance
of
getting A LOT of money ... a much better chance than buying a lottery
ticket!!!
So, having these questions answered, I invested EXACTLY $7.92 ... six
$1.00 bills and six 32 cent postage stamps ... and boy am I glad I did
!!!
Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I
still
figured it would end soon, and didn't give it another thought. But the
money
just continued coming in. In my first week, I made about $20.00 to
$30.00
dollars. By the end of the second week I had a mad total of $1,000.00
!!!!!
In the third week I had over $10,000.00 and it was still growing. This
is
now
my fourth week and I have made a total of just over $42,000.00 and it's
still
coming in .....
It's certainly worth $6.00 and 6 stamps !!!
So now I'm reposting this so I can make even more money!  The *ONLY*
thing
stopping *ANYONE* from enrichening their own bank account is pure
laziness ! It took me all of 5 MINUTES to print this out, follow the
directions, and begin posting to newsgroups.  It took me a mere 45
minutes to post to over 200 newsgroups.  And for this GRAND TOTAL
investment of $ 7.92 (US) and under ONE HOUR of my time, I have reaped
an incredible amount of money -- like nothing I've ever even heard of
anywhere before !  'Nuff said !
Let me tell you how this works, and most importantly, why it works.
Also,
make sure you print a copy of this article now, so you can get the
information
off of it when you need it. The process is very simple and consists of
THREE
easy steps.
============
HOW IT WORKS
============
Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses:
STEP 1:
------
Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each
piece of paper:
    PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST.
    $1 US DOLLAR PROCESSING FEE IN ENCLOSED.
(THIS IS KEY AS THIS IS WHAT MAKES IT LEGAL SINCE YOU ARE PAYING FOR
AND LATER OFFERING A SERVICE).
Now get 6 $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of
paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope to prevent
theft/robbery. Then, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and
seal them. You should now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece
of paper stating the above phrase and a U.S. $1.00 bill.

#1   JA Gualtieri
     45-350 Columbia St. W.
     Waterloo, ON, Canada
     N2L 6G3

#2   ASHLE
     347 JAMBOREE
     MANCHESTER, MO 63021

#3  North Shore Designs 2
       330 Edgewater Road
       Pasadena, MD 21122

#4  H.P.
      P.O. Box 421635
      Middletown, OH  45042-7934


#5   RON BARNES
     1620 S. TYLER
     TACOMA, WA 98405

#6  Ed Plant
    610 Millcreek Ln.
    Leander, Texas 78641

STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the
other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name as
number 6 on the list.  (If you want to remain anonymous, put a nickname,
but the address MUST be correct. It, of course, MUST contain your
country, state/district/area, zip code, etc!!! You wouldn't want your
money to fly away, wouldn't you?!?!).
STEP 3: Now post your amended article to at least 200 newsgroups.
Remember, 200 postings is just a guideline. The more you post, the
more money you make!
Don't know HOW to post in the news groups? Well do exactly the
following:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS FAST WITH YOUR WEB BROWSER:
                The fastest way to post a newsletter:
Highlight and COPY(Ctrl-C) the text of this posted message and
PASTE(Ctrl-V) it into a plain text editor(as Wordpad) and save it.
After you have made the necessary changes that are stated above,
simply COPY(Ctrl-C) and PASTE(Ctrl-V) the text into the message
composition window, after selecting a newsgroup, and post it! (Or
you can attach the file, without writing nothing to the message window.)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        If you have Netscape Navigator 3.0 do the following:
1. Click on any newsgroup like normal, then click on 'TO NEWS'. This
will bring up a box to type a message in.
2. Leave the newsgroup box like it is, change the subject box to
something flashy, something to catch the eye, as "$$$ NEED CASH $$$?!!
READ HERE!$!$!$" or "$$$!!!MAKE FAST CASH, YOU CAN'T LOSE!!!$$$". Or
you can use my subject title.
3. Now click on 'ATTACHMENTS'. Then click on 'ATTACH FILE'. Find your
file on your Hard Disk(the one you saved from the text editor). Once
you find it, click on it and then click 'OPEN' and 'OK'. You sould now
see
your file name in the attachments box.
4. Now click on 'SEND'/'POST'. You see? Now you just have 199 to
go!!!(Don't worry, it's easy and quick once you get used to it.)
NOTE: All the versions of Netscape Navigator's are similar to each
other, so you'll have no problem to do this if you don't have Netscape
Navigator 3.0.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                !QUICK TIP!
             (For Netscape Navigator 3.x and above)
You can post this message to many newsgroups at a time, by simply
selecting a newsgroup near the top of the screen, hold down the SHIFT,
and then select a newsgroup near the bottom of the screen. All of the
newsgroups in/between will be selected. After that, you follow/do the
basic steps, stated below at this letter, except of step #1. You can
go to the page stated below in this letter and click on a newsgroup to
open up the newsgroups window. Once you've done this, in the same window
go
to 'OPTIONS', and then mark 'SHOW ALL NEWSGROUPS' and 'SHOW ALL
MESSAGES'. Now you can see all the newsgroups and you can apply easier
the above tip.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        If you have MS Internet Explorer do the following:
1. Go to the newsgroups and press 'POST AN ARTICLE'. To the new window
type your headline in the subject area and then click in the large
window below. There either PASTE your letter(which it's been copied
from the text editor), or attach the file which contains it.
2. Then click on 'SEND' or 'OK'.
NOTE: All versions of MS Internet Explorer are similar to each other,
so you won't have any problem doing this.
GENERAL NOTES ON POSTING: A nice page where you'll find all the
newsgroups if you want help is http://www.liszt.com/ (When you go to
the home page, click on the link 'Newsgroup Directory'). But I don't
think
you'll have any problem posting because it's very easy once you've
found the newsgroups. All these web browsers are similar. It doesn't
matter
which one you have.(But it makes it very easy if you have Netscape
Navigator 3.0 or later. You may download it from the Internet if you
don't have it.) You just have to remember the basic steps, stated
below.
BASIC STEPS FOR POSTING:
1. Find a newsgroup and you click on it.
2. You click on 'POST AN/NEW ARTICLE' or 'TO NEWS' or anything else
similar to these.
3. You type your flashy headline in the subject box.
4. Now, either you attach the file containing your amended letter, or
you PASTE the letter.(You have to COPY it from the text editor, of
course, from before.)
5. Finaly, you click on 'SEND' or 'POST' or 'OK', whatever is there.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU
WILL
MAKE!! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200**
That's it! You will begin receiving money from around the world within
day's! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box due to the large
amount of mail you receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can
invent a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it.
**JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.**
=================
Now the WHY part:
=================
Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very low
example). So then I made $5.00 with my name at #6 on the letter. Now,
each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200
postings, each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of
the original 5, that is another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make
200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will
bring in an additional $125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and
post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 replies each,
I will make an additional $626.00! OK, now here is the fun part, each of
those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2 and they
each only receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125
persons will all deliver this message to 200 newsgroups with my name at
#1 and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I will receive
$15,625,00! With a original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING!  And as
I said 5 responses is actually VERY LOW! Average is probable 20 to 30!
So lets put those figures at just 15 responses per person. Here is what
you will make:
at #6 $15.00
at #5 $225.00
at #4 $3,375.00
at #3 $50,625.00
at #2 $759,375.00
at #1 $11,390,625.00
When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest
posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to names on the
list, putting your name at number 6 again. And start posting again.
The thing to remember is, do you realize that thousands of people all
over the world are joining the internet and reading these articles
everyday, JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So can you afford $6.00 and see if
it really works?? I think so... People have said, "what if the plan is
played out and no one sends you the money? So what! What are the chances
of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest
people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are
willing to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users,
every day, with thousands of those joining the actual internet.
Remember,
play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will work. You just have to be honest.
** By the way, if you try to deceive people by posting the messages with
your name in the list and not sending the money to the rest of the
people already on the list, you will NOT get as much. Someone I talked
to knew someone who did that and he only made about $150.00, and
that's after seven or eight weeks! Then he sent the 6 $1.00 bills,
people added him to their lists, and in 4-5 weeks he had over $10k. This
is the fairest and most honest way I have ever seen to share the wealth
of the world without costing anything but our time!!! You also may want
to buy mailing and e-mail lists for future dollars.
Make sure you print this article out RIGHT NOW, also. Try to keep a
list of everyone that sends you money and always keep an eye on the
newsgroups to make sure everyone is playing fairly. Remember, HONESTY
IS THE BEST POLICY. You don't need to cheat the basic idea to make the
money!!
GOOD LUCK to all and please play fairly and reap the huge rewards from
this, which is tons of extra CASH.
Please remember to declare your extra income. Thanks once again...

FIVE TIMES THE INCOME POTENTIAL!
   AND FIVE TIMES FASTER! !

Dear friend,

I have avoided the various "Fast Money" making systems found on the
Internet for some time now.  I came to be aggravated by them and
considered
them as pure spam. But when I read the following post of an updated
version, which clearly answered many of my questions about the structure
and legality of these systems, I began to reconsider. I thought about
many
opportunities I have missed out in my life because of my tendencies to
be
both a  "doubter" and a procrastinator. No, I decided I was not going to
let myself be left behind again, especially when investing only $5.00, 5
envelopes and stamps, and a few hours work.

Here is the posting of the newest version of the system I found in one
newsgroup:

PRINT THIS POSTING OUT NOW, SPEND A FEW MINUTES CAREFULLY READING IT
THROUGH, AND CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THIS SYSTEM IS WORTH THE SMALL
INVESTMENT OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY.

JUST GET INVOLVED, AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS!

Why are there so many versions of "Fast Money" making systems on the
Internet? Because the basic algorithm, the basic process, followed by
each
system offers the potential to make a great amount of money with a small
investment of time and money.

What are the basic systems and why are they legal? Each system follows
the
same basic steps, which define a business by offering others the ability
to
get involved using the system you advertise in newsgroups on the
Internet
and accepting a small fee for the requests of those who respond to be
added
to your mailing list.  Yes, you will be in the business of creating your
own mailing list. Their requests to be added to your mailing list, which
is
sent with $1.00 fee for your service, define a legal business
opportunity
under U.  S. Postal and Lottery Laws --- a legal business opportunity
for
you which is covered in title 18, section 1302 and 1342 of the U. S.
Postal
and Lottery Laws.

Now, what one does, or does not do, with the mailing list being
constructed
is a personal decision. One could decide to do nothing with this list,
to
use it as a tool in building another business or expanding an existing
business. This decision is up to the creator of the mailing list  --
this
decision is up to you.

Because of the abundance of postings advertising the various systems,
one
may be led to believe that too many people are involved in these
moneymaking opportunities. However, one must keep in mind that each
person
involved places multiple posts --- the minimum suggested for this
business
being 500 positing.  So, in actuality there are far fewer people
currently
involved, and far more people yet to become involved, than one may
think.

   FIVE TIMES THE MONEYMAKING POTENTIAL?

This system consists of a list of 5 addresses, an investment of $5.00 --
$1
for each of your requests to be added to the mailing lists of the 5
people
listed in this advertisement -- ONLY 5 envelopes and stamps, and a
couple
of hours work. This system definition has also eliminated the fluff of
declaration of how much others have made and how much you can make ---
this
depends upon the time you invest in this moneymaking opportunity. You
must
remember one important rule of a successful business:

   ADVERTISE, ADVERTISE, AND ADVERTISE!!!

You must also remember that each day there are thousands of new users on
the Internet, users for you to reach through your advertising. The more
effort you spend posting your business opportunity to others, the larger
the return on your small $5.00 investment and time spent working to
become
successful.

Here are the basic steps to be followed without variation:

Step 1) 
Send immediately $1.00 in U. S.  Currency to each of the 5 people on the
list below. Wrap the bill in a note with the words: "Please put me on
your
mailing list." Include your address. You do not need to include your
name
if you choose not so. In order to prevent thievery be sure that your
$1.00
is folded in your letter requesting to be added to one's mailing list.

#1      W. Manwaring
          1401 Lewisvill Rd.
          Minden, LA 71055

#5      B. Peterson
          9 Fernhill Rd.
          Whaton, NJ 07885

                                                                        
Step 2)
Now take the #1 name off the list, move the other names up (5 becomes 4,
4
becomes 3, etc.) and add your name as #5 on the list.

Step 3)
Post this updated listing with your address in  #5 in at least 500 news
groups. Try posting to at least 50 groups per day.  You can simply copy
the
contents of this letter and post it to the news groups of your choice.
(If
you are not sure how, see the description below.) There are thousands of
news groups on the Internet.  Also, please post in appropriate groups
and
spread your postings over many different local and international areas. 
You may find services which list available news groups by using one of
the
web searching programs and searching for "news groups."

In a short time, if you spend the time advertising your business
opportunity, others' requests to be added to your mailing list should
begin
rolling in. As more time passes and others get involved, the number of
requests and $1.00 fees you will receive will multiply! JUST ENJOY!


DIRECTIONS -- HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS

Step 1)
You do not need to re-type this letter to do your own posting; simply
put
your cursor at the beginning of this letter and click and hold down your
mouse button. While continuing to hold down the mouse button, drag your
cursor to the bottom of this document and over to just after the last
character, and release the mouse button. At this point the entire letter
should be highlighted. Then, from the 'edit' pull down menu at the top
of
your screen select  'copy'. This will copy the entire letter into your
computer memory.

Step 2)
Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the
page. 
From the 'edit' pull down menu select  'paste.' This will paste a copy
of
the letter into notepad so that you can add your name to the list. 
Remember to eliminate the #1 name, move everyone up a spot (re-number
everyone else's positions), and add your self in as #5.

Step 3)
Save your new notepad files as a .txt file.  If you want to do your
postings in different sittings, you'll always have this file to go back
to.

*** FOR NETSCAPE USERS ***
Step 4)
Within the Netscape program, go to the pull-down window entitled
'Window'
and select 'NetscapeNews.'  Then from the pull-down menu 'Options,'
select
'Show All Newsgroups'.  After a few moments a list of all the newsgroups
on
your server will show up.  Click on any newsgroup you desire. From
within
this newsgroup, click on the 'TO NEWS' button, which should be at the
top
left corner of the newsgroups page. This will bring up a message box.

Step 5)
Fill in the Subject.  This will be the header that everyone sees as they
scroll through the list of postings in a particular group.

Step 6)
Highlight the entire contents of your  .txt file and copy them using the
same technique as before. Go back to the newsgroup 'TO NEWS' posting you
are creating and paste the letter into the body of your posting.

Step 7)
Hit the 'Send' button in the upper left corner. You are done with your
first one! Congratulations, and keep going!!!

*** FOR INTERNET EXPLORER USERS ***
Step 4)
Go to the newsgroups and select 'Post an Article'.

Step 5)
Fill in the Subject.

Step 6)
Same as #6 above.

Step 7)
Hit the 'Post' button.

I have experienced that Fry's Electronic on Brokaw Rd., San Jose has
very bad customer service, especially on returning stuffs from
customers. When they sold something out they never wanted  to ( or they
made me feel like that, based on my case )  receive the returning stuffs
friendly. They tried to figure out your stuffs had  been damaged by you
or some reasons else to refuse receiving them back. Fry's were a famous
stores about electronic, software, computer,...stuffs. But now they are
famous on tricking their customers. If you are not improve your customer
services. You gotta be "damaged" yourself, Fry's!!!

Tom,

LOVED your Web page. One of my sons was here with me. I was showing him 
how newsgroups operate. We both cracked up when we saw your pictures. 
Did you get a digital camera or scanner? Also, I think it was great how 
you did each of your kids. Nice family. Left your poor wife out of it 
though. Shame, shame. Now my sons want their pictures on my web page. 
Sheesh.

Bob

I thought that Tom was going to bail out of Earthlink.

I read that Pacific Bell is now going to enter into the Internet provider
fray.  The more competition the better.

Nice to read you here Tom. Gotta get Tina on here.

I figure Apple will go for the high end business applications they do so
well (graphics houses) on their hardware. OS on the low end. Just as you
said. Should have done it years ago. Oh well, I don't own their stock. I
should have bought it at 14- 10 years ago. I thought about it.

Yes, I go through times when I have alot of freeze ups. It may be the same
situation as you describe. There is an extension you can install called
Netscape defrost. I am not sure if it works. I do not know for certain I
have less freeze ups because I have it installed. It is a talisman. A leap
of faith. Rabbit's foot? http://cygnus.rsabbs.com/~ssykes/nsdefrost.html.

Good luck and keep the faith :)

I've been having fewer problems with earthlink lately. But, I am having 
more trouble with NetScape 2.0. My machine is freezing up quite often. 
It seems to happen if I have Netscape on and get disconnected. When I 
use the Internet dialer while Netscape is still open, it often freezes 
up. Anyone else having this problem?

Yes, that would be nice.

I read that Pacific Bell in the near future will be offering a package
that includes both their internet access and access to AOL. That would be
nice for those who like the hominess of AOL but still have the full power
internet access. Reyes would probably dig it.

We reviewed movies on Maclectic, so I guess we can do so here as well.

I saw two movies the last couple of weeks. SpyHard with Leslie Nielson 
was a disappointment. A few good laughs, but most of the jokes were old 
and infantile. Many of them were in reference to movies that many 
younger people will not know anything about, such as Butch Cassidy and 
the Sundance Kid. I'd give it 2 ** out of 5 *****


I saw DragonHart today. I liked it a lot, but I am a sucker for movies 
about Knights and dragons and stuff like that. The special effects are 
incredible. You WILL believe the dragon is real. Sean Connery's voice is 
great as Dragco, the dragon. Dennis Quaid is good too, is he ever bad in 
a movie? Very clean. No sex, no swearing, not very violent for this type 
of a movie. Lots of great action and make believe stuff. Kids and grown 
ups will both like it. **** out of *****

Eureka! (I found it!)

Hi everyone!
   I'm Tina Gunther, female half of the infamous Dave-and-Tina gang. I
have a real gift for getting lost. That's the main reason it took me so
long to find my way here. There were also a few settings in our AOL
preferences that needed to be reset.
   As far as personal introduction goes, most of my info also applies to
Dave. We're charter members of WAMUG. I'm currently Secretary and Dave is
a Board-Member-at-Large, although at times he fills in for President Tom
at meetings. Our 19th wedding anniversary is next month.
   I'm not sure what other information to share here. Most of you know me
already. If you have any questions, ask.

You liked the movie a lot better than the WDN guy did. He really liked the
dragon, Draco, but hated the rest of the movie. He also commented that the
battle scenes were too graphic for the younger kids who would otherwise
enjoy the movie. How graphic was it?

How did I get here through AOL?
To make an embarrassingly long story short,
once I finished making wrong turns
and adjusting preferences,
I picked "Internet Connection."
Then I picked "Newsgroups."
Then I picked "Expert Add." 
Then I typed in "com.priv"
and clicked the "Add" button.
Then I picked "Read My Newsgroups."
Then I picked "com.priv."
Then I double-clicked on the first line
and started reading messages.

>> LOVED your Web page. One of my sons was here with me. I was showing him how newsgroups operate. We both cracked up when we saw your pictures. Did you get a digital camera or scanner? Also, I think it was great how you did each of your kids. Nice family. Left your poor wife out of it though. Shame, shame. Now my sons want their pictures on my web page. Sheesh. <<

I didn't leave my wife out, SHE wanted to be left out. (Something 
about not having a good enough picture. I showed her the ones I used, 
she claims not to be a leming.)

I was playing around with an 8mm video camera hookup to a 950 and 
snaped those frames. Had a great time doing it.

Be prepaired to laugh.)

I was/am going to leave Earthlink. I'm finding I cannot reliably get 
or send mail. Ticks me off.

The problem is finding a more reliable service provider in my toll 
zone. (Not as easy as it sounds)

I went to the Pac Bell page to check out their excellent ISDN page 
(http://www.pacbell.com) and looked into their internet providing. But 
since I'm a GTE customer, I checked them out (http://www.gte.com) and 
saw that they were going into the provider business big time. 
Internet, Web, Mail, 1MB of web space, news groups, the works. Then I 
saw that they are (so far) only offered in areas in the mid-west and 
east coast.

Can't win for loosing.

I had Net Voyage back last August for a week. I could not connect so I
canceled. Last month they billed me for service for that month. You have
to watch your credit card statements with all this automatic charging for
services going on now a days. I am having a heck of a time getting that
$20 credited back to me.

Here is a number I use for Earthlink when the others don't work. 714-871-0966.
It is a Fullerton number and used to be one of those pay for use numbers.
I have never been charged because now we have unlimited use. Earthlink
will not tell you about this number because I think they get charged by
UUNET. Seems  a bit slow compared to the Anaheim number when it is working
well. Oh! you MUST Use ELN/username in your configuration. The ELN/ before
your username. I don't Know about you but I have to use a "P" in front of
my username for some reason.

Something else that Peter Graves mentioned in that BackChat interview:
Before Mission Impossible, he starred in the TV series Fury about a boy
and his horse! Bob and I, and Bill, I think, were exchanging nostalgia
remarks on Maclectic and this series came up. However, I haven't been able
to find it listed in any of the TV info sources I've checked. Here is
corroboration that we're not all imagining the show!

You knew this section would come up, didn't you? I'll pretend this is a 
Maclectic thread, not Wamug, so nobody will get mad.

What do you think about these 300 and so Republicans that were checked 
out by the FBI and IRS and then the report sent to the Whitehouse? Even 
Nixon didn't do that! (Though he is often incorrectly accused of doing 
that.) Will this get Clinton in trouble? No apology so far from the 
White House.

 WOW! Need easy cash fast?

Chris Thompson here.  THIS REALLY DOES WORK!!!!
It only cost me the postage and $5.

READ ON.


Hello! I've got some awesome news that I think you need to take
two minutes to read if you have ever thought "How could I make
some serious cash in a hurry???" , or been in serious debt,
ready to do almost anything to get the money needed to pay off
those bill collectors.  So grab a snack, a warm cup of coffee, or
a glass of your favorite beverage, get comfortable and listen to
this interesting, exciting find!

(If you're reading this on-line, I suggest that you quickly
download it to your hard drive FIRST, just in case some do-gooder
takes it off the news board.  You can always read it with a text
editor, like Windows Notepad.  Also, you will find this copy on
your disk to be most useful, as you will later see.  Just use the
File: Save As command.)

Let me start by saying that I FINALLY FOUND IT!  That's right!  I
found it! And I HATE GET RICH QUICK SCHEMES!! I hate those schemes
like multi-level marketing, mail-order schemes, envelope stuffing
scams, 900 number scams... the list goes on forever.  I have tried
every darn get rich quick scheme out there over the past 12 years.
I somehow got on mailing lists for people looking to make money
(more like 'desperate stupid people who will try anything for
money!').  Well,  when I was a teenager,  these claims to 'get me
rich quick' sounded irresistible!  I would shell out $14.95 here,
$29.95 there, $24.95 here, and another $49.95 there.  I had maxed
out my new Circuit City Card AND my Visa...   I was desperate for
money!!  So, I gave them all a chance but failed at every one of
them!  Maybe they worked for some people, but not for me.
Eventually, I just tossed that JUNK MAIL in the trash when I got
the mail.  I recognized it right away.  I can smell a money scam
from a mile away these days,  SO I THOUGHT.... I thought I could
sniff out a scam easily.  WAS I WRONG!!

...I LOVE THE INTERNET!!!

I was scanning thru a NEWSGROUP and saw an article stating to GET
CASH FAST!!  I thought... "Here on the Internet??  Well, I'll just
have to see what schemes could possibly be on the internet."
The>article described a way to MAIL A ONE DOLLAR BILL TO ONLY
FIVE>PEOPLE AND MAKE $50,000 IN CASH WITHIN 4 WEEKS!  Well, the more
Ithought about it, the more I became very curious.  Why?  Because
of the way it worked AND BECAUSE IT WOULD ONLY COST ME FIVE
DOLLARS (AND FIVE STAMPS), THAT'S ALL I EVER PAY.... EVER!!

Ok, so the $50,000 in cash was maybe a tough amount to reach, but
it was possible.  I figured that I could at least get a return of
$1,000 or so.  So I did it!!  As per the instructions in the
article, I mailed out ('snail mail'for you e-mail fanatics) a
single dollar bill to each of the five people on the list that
was contained in the article.  I included a small note, with the
dollar, that stated "Please Add Me To Your List."  I then removed
the first position name of the five names listed and moved
everyone up one position, and I put my name in position five of
the list.  This is how the money starts rolling in!  I then took
this revised article now with my name on the list and REPOSTED IT
ON AS MANY NEWSGROUPS AND LOCAL BULLETIN BOARD MESSAGE AREAS THAT
I KNEW.  I then waited to watch the money come in... prepared to
maybe receive about $1000 to $1500 in cash or so....

But what a welcome surprise when those envelopes kept coming in!!!
I knew what they were as soon as I saw the return addresses from
people all over the world - Most from the U.S., but some from
Canada, even some from Australia!  I tell you, THAT WAS EXCITING!!
So how much did I get in total return?  $1000? $5000?  Not even!!!
I received a total of $23,343!!!  I couldn't believe it!!

I now have a brand new black Acura Integra to speak for, due to
this!! Now after almost 8 months, I am ready to do it again!!! So
maybe it was possible to get $50,000 in cash, I don't know, but IT
COMPLETELY DEPENDS ON YOU, THE INDIVIDUAL!  You must follow
through and repost this article everywhere you can think of!
The more postings you achieve will determine how much cash will
arrive in your very own mailbox!!  It's just too easy to pass
up!!!

Let's review the reasons why you should do this:  The only cost
factors are for the five stamps, the 5 envelopes and the 5 one
dollar bills that you send out to the listed names by snail mail
(US Postal Service Mail).  Then just simply repost the article
WITH YOUR NAME ADDED) to all the newsgroups and local BBS's you
can.  Then sit back and, (ironically), enjoy walking (you can runif
you like! :o)  ) down your driveway to your mailbox and scoop up
your rewards!!  We all have five dollars to put into such an easy
effortless investment with SPECTACULAR REALISTIC RETURNS OF
$15,000 to $25,000 in about 3-5 weeks!  So HOLD OFF ON THOSE
LOTTERY NUMBERS FOR TODAY, EAT AT HOME TONIGHT INSTEAD OF TAKEOUT
FROM McDONALDS AND INVEST FIVE DOLLARS IN THIS AMAZING MONEY
MAKING SYSTEM NOW!!!  YOU CAN'T LOSE!!

So how do you do it exactly, you ask?  I have carefully provided
the most detailed, yet straightforward instructions on how to
easily get this underway and get your cash on its way.  SO, ARE
YOU READY TO MAKE SOME CASH!!!??  HERE WE GO!!!

*** (THE LIST OF NAMES IS AT THE END OF THIS ARTICLE.) ***

OK,  Read this carefully.  Get a printout of this information, if
you like, so you can easily refer to it as often as needed.  (Not
that it's difficult or anything.)

INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  Take a sheet of paper and write on it the following: "Please
add my name to your list".  This creates a service out of this
money making system and thus making it completely legal.  You are
not just randomly sending a dollar to someone, you are paying one
dollar for a legitimate service.  Make sure  you include your name
and address.  I assure you that,  again,  this is completely
legal!  For a neat little twist, also write what slot their name
was in:  "You were in slot 3", just to add a little fun!  This is
all about having fun and making money at the same time!

2.  Now fold this sheet of paper around a dollar bill, (no checks
or money orders), and put them into an envelope and send it on its
way to the five people listed.  The folding of the paper around
the bill will ensure its arrival to its recipient. THIS STEP IS
IMPORTANT!!  (Otherwise, some unscrupulous mail delivery person
may see what's inside and start helping himself to all the
thousands of envelopes arriving!)

3.  Now listen carefully, here's where you get YOUR MONEY COMING
TO YOUR MAILBOX.  Look at the list of five people;  remove the
first name from position one and move everyone on the list up
one slot on the list.  Position 2 name will now move to the
position 1 slot,  position 3 will now become position 2, 4 will
be 3, 5 will be 4.  Now put your name, address, zipcode AND
COUNTRY in position 5, the bottom position on the list.

4.  Now upload this updated file to as many newsgroups and local
bulletin boards' message areas & file sections as possible.  Give
a catchy description of the file so it gets noticed!!  Such as:
"NEED FAST CASH?, HERE IT IS!" or "NEED CASH TO PAY OFF YOUR
DEBTS??",  etc.  And the more uploads, the more money you will
make, and of course, the more money the others on the list will
make too.  LET'S ALL TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER BY BEING HONEST AND
BY PUTTING FORTH 120 PERCENT INTO THIS PROFITABLE & AMAZING
SYSTEM!!!  You'll reap the benefits, believe me!!! Set a goal for
the number of total uploads you'll post, such as 15-20 postings
or more!  Always have a goal in mind!!! If you can UUE encode the
file when uploading,  that will make it easier for the people to
receive it and have it downloaded to their hard drive.  That way
they get a copy of the article right on their computer without
hassles of viewing and then saving the article from the File menu.
DON'T ALTER THE FILE TYPE, leave it as an MS-DOS Text file. The
best test is to be able to view this file using Microsoft's
Notepad for Windows 3.x or WordPad for Windows '95.  (Do NOT use
the WordWrap option.  It will screw the margins up!) If the margins
look right without making the screen slide left or right when at
the ends of the sentences, you're in business!

5.  If you need help uploading, simply ask the sysop of the BBS,
or "POST" a message on a newsgroup asking how to post a file,
tell them who your Internet provider is and PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS BE
GLAD TO HELP.  I would try to describe how to do it but there are
simply too many internet software packages with slightly different
yet relatively simple ways to post or upload a file.  Just ask for
help or look in the help section for 'posting'. I do know that for
GNN, you simply select 'POST' then enter a catchy description
under the subject box, choose 'ATTACH', selecting 'UUE' and NOT
'TXT', then choose 'Browse' to go look for the file. Find your
text file, i.e. CASH.TXT, and click on it and choose 'OK'.  Place
a one line statement in the main body section of the message post
screen. Something like "Download this to read how to get cash
arriving in your mailbox with no paybacks!" or whatever.  Just
make sure it represents its true feasibility, NOT something
like... "Get one million dollars flooding in your mailbox in two
days!"  You'll never get ANY responses!

6.  And this is the step I like.  JUST SIT BACK AND ENJOY LIFE
BECAUSE CASH IS ON ITS WAY!!  Expect to see a little money
start to trickle in around 2 weeks, but AT ABOUT WEEKS 3 & 4, THE
MONEY STORM WILL HIT YOUR MAILBOX!! All you have to do is take it
out of the mailbox and try not to scream too loud (outside anyway)
when you realize YOU HIT THE BIG TIME AT LAST!!

7.  So go PAY OFF YOUR BILLS AND DEBTS and then get that something
 special you always wanted or buy that special person in your life
 (or the one you want in your life) a gift they'll never forget.
 ENJOY LIFE!

 8.  Now when you get low on this money supply,  simply re-activate
 this file again; Reposting it in the old places where you
 originally posted and possibly some new places you now know of.
 Don't ever lose this file, always keep a copy at your reach for
 when you ever need cash.  THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE TOOL THAT YOU CAN
 ALWAYS RE-USE TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHEN CASH IS NEEDED!

 9.  (This step added by Charles Reiley).  Hello, This is exciting
 sn't it?!  While I'm on the list, just add a note saying "Please
 include extra money tips" with your name & E-MAIL address, and I
 will (FOR FREE) send you some neat methods to increase the money
 you will receive with this plan. Why?... Why not? I'm not a
 selfish jerk... I like helping out others. E-mail just makes it a
 touch easier and cheaper, too!  After I drop off the list, I can
 no longer offer you this advice, obviously, but maybe someone else
 who gets my tips will offer and simply replace my name on this
 step number 9. Good luck and give this plan your all, it will
 definitely pay off! Like Mike said, HAVE FUN WITH IT!!!

Gee, I didn't know you were so clever, Alan! I was wondering why the 
church had a silver tone to it, now I know. I just wish I had seen Tom's 
nose get bloodied. I miss all the good stuff. I ought to be nice to him 
though. He installed my RAM for me. Everything works now! Amazing.

I sure did like that season finale. It tied alot of things together and
created some questions. Such as: where did Delen go when she switched time
stabilizers with Sheridan?

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah. -- May 14, 1996 To better provide Macintosh users
worldwide information and software, the moderators who maintain the
Info-Mac Internet Archive along with Pacific HiTech, Inc. today announced
a World Wide Web site dedicated to the archive.

The Info-Mac Archive is the largest collection of Macintosh shareware and
freeware (over 2.0 gigabytes) serving the Macintosh community for over
ten years. Info-Mac is run solely on a volunteer effort working daily to
gather and organize hundreds of programs a month, made available on
'mirrors' (or copies) of the site worldwide.

The new World Wide Web site will provide information to new users of the
site and the Internet on to how to access the software, posting
guidelines, detailed instructions for uploading software to the site,
mirror locations, information about the Info-Mac Digest (a semi-daily
periodical that provides a forum for Macintosh users of all levels and
announcements of new additions to the site), and much more. Links are
also provided to highlight search engines dedicated to Info-Mac that
allow searches for specific files or information from the Info-Mac
Digest. This site is desgined to be a central source for a wide variety
Macintosh resources.

The site was created with the help of Pacific HiTech and will be located
there. Pacific HiTech is a longtime supporter of Info-Mac and is the
exclusive distributor of CD-ROMs of the archive, producing Info-Mac
titles since 1992.

The Info-Mac Archive is moving forward in its previously announced
relocation from its current home at Stanford to MIT on its new machine
donated by America OnLine. Contributors will have already noticed files
can submitted to this new machine at info-mac.org. Once there, Info-Mac
will grow significantly due to increased capacity. "There is no question
that more software is being developed for the Macintosh and made freely
available than ever before, with submissions to the site being made at an
increasing rate," said the archivist of the site. "We have nearly ten
thousand programs and that number is only limited by space, which will
change soon."

The site is located at <http://www.pht.com/info-mac/>. It will be kept up
to date, continuing to provide that latest information and the most and
newest software available. The Info-Mac moderators are currently Liam
Breck, Gordon Watts, Adam Engst, and Demitri Muna.

Neither MIT nor Stanford University is affiliated with the Info-Mac
Network or Pacific HiTech in any way.

Have any of you tried out Netscape Defrost? This is an extension that is 
supposed to keep Netscape from freezing. I've installed it and so far, 
so good, but it's too soon to really tell. I have had a lot of trouble 
with Netscape freezing on me in the past, especially when earthlink 
disconnects me and I try to reconnect. I will add it to this message as 
an attachment, but I don't know how that works with newsgroups, but if 
it works, let me know.

Bob

Cool. The attachments hook onto the message. I didn't know it worked 
that way. I don't know if they are good. Looked like they were split up 
into two sections, but there is the http site you can go to and get the 
whole thing yourself. Good luck,

Bob

Tom did a good job coping with the Hot Disk by Committee demo. There was a
lot of audience participation as pros and cons of various options were
debated. We might try the build-your-own-Hot-Disk sign-up sheet again. For
several of the items, one or two people wanted it a lot but most of the
group wasn't interested.
   We did have one person who said he would be interested in doing Hot
Disks starting in September but he won't have time until then.

No Ovaltine for me. It's got malt in it and I've never liked malt, even as
a kid. A strong whiff of it makes me want to throw up. Nestle's Quik has
always been good, though.

I found out more about Mission Impossible-the Movie over this last
weekend. I don't plan to go see it and I don't expect any classic IMF fan
to approve of the movie. I think the producers should be ashamed of
themselves.

Hey Tina. If you use the newsgroups enough you'll get used to the spams.
You won't like it, but you'll get used to it. In fact you won't even open
those messages. I am amazed at how few show up here. Bob sure found a

I hope someone noticed that I had been gone for awhile. Here's the 
scoop:

A few weeks ago Tom upgraded my Performa from 8 megs to 20. I was a 
very grateful camper. A few days later, while working on a big project 
with a lot of graphics, my Performa crashed. When I would try to start 
up again, the smiley face would come on and stick there. Nothing else 
could access the Performa-Startup CD, Zip Drive, hard drives. Tom was 
on vacation...Tom should not be allowed to go on vacations. So I went 
to Fry's and bought a new hard drive. It wouldn't fit or work. Found 
out there is a type of Drive called a differential drive. It can't be 
the ID or last drive in the daisy chain. So, I went back and to 
exchange it. I went through about 5 drives and a 45 minute wait 
before I got one that would work. Tom put it in and it does work fine, 
but we can't access my original Apple Drive. The Apple Drive is an AT 
ID drive, not a Scuzzy drive, so we couldn't use anything like scummy 
Probe to work on it. Now I am trying to find a guy who can work on 
drives. CompUSA can't do it. Anyone know where Rick Schultz is in CO?

Oh, I'm familiar with spams. I resent them and do what I can to discourage
people from being fooled into thinking that they are inoffensive
advertising. Too many people are being taken in by claims that most

I'm watching Pop Goes the Fourth on A&E. They just had a neat intro. The
voice of Peter Graves offered the orchestra leader the mission of playing
the Mission Impossible show theme. "Of course, if you or any
instrumentalist misses a note of this difficult 5/4 time, the Secretary
will disavow any knowledge of your existence." Naturally, the message
self-destructed in 5 seconds as white smoke puffed out of the speakers.
You'll be glad to know that the mission was completed successfully.

It depends on your news reader Tina. Most of the time groups that you
subscribe to do not show the old articles, but you can make a selection in
your software to "show old articles" or something like that.  Depending on
the server, they will only keep them around for a certain amount of time
and only (in high use groups) so many.  So either they timed out or ,most
likely, your software doesn't show them.

This is so weird Tom. Nobody I have talked to even knew that these 
drives were being used. I don't get it. Tina has given me a lead at 
Biola, but I'm worried that they won't know about it either. Very 
strange indeed. But, keep looking and let me know if you find anyone 
who knows anything about this. I'd sure like to get one file off of 
there.

I knew that the internals were IDE. It is the same type drive they use in
the IBMs.  I think they wanted to save money.

In one way it is a good thing. I got a 2.5 gig drive for less than 
$400.00. You can't get mac drives as cheaply as the IBM drives. But 
the data recovery problems look to be very challenging to me. Now, 
what I don't understand is that before the crash, Nortons did see the 
drive and could work on it. So could Scsi Probe. But after the crash, 
even though the drive still could begin a start up process, nothing 
could see it in the scsi chain. So, I don't understand that and why I 
can't find some utility that can see it. Obviously, every Performa 
user has this potential problem. Someone must have run into it before 
me, so there should be some history to the situation and a solution 
out there as well.

Hello! I've got some awesome news that I think you need to take

two minutes to read if you have ever thought "How could I make

some serious cash in a hurry???" , or been in serious debt,

ready to do almost anything to get the money needed to pay off

those bill collectors.  So grab a snack, a warm cup of coffee, or

a glass of your favorite beverage, get comfortable and listen to

this interesting, exciting find!



(If you're reading this on-line, I suggest that you quickly

download it to your hard drive FIRST, just in case some do-gooder

takes it off the news board.  You can always read it with a text

editor, like Windows Notepad.  Also, you will find this copy on

your disk to be most useful, as you will later see.  Just use the

File: Save As command.)



Let me start by saying that I FINALLY FOUND IT!  That's right!  I

found it! And I HATE GET RICH QUICK SCHEMES!! I hate those schemes

like multi-level marketing, mail-order schemes, envelope stuffing

scams, 900 number scams... the list goes on forever.  I have tried

every darn get rich quick scheme out there over the past 12 years.

I somehow got on mailing lists for people looking to make money

(more like 'desperate stupid people who will try anything for

money!').  Well,  when I was a teenager,  these claims to 'get me

rich quick' sounded irresistible!  I would shell out $14.95 here,

$29.95 there, $24.95 here, and another $49.95 there.  I had maxed

out my new Circuit City Card AND my Visa...   I was desperate for

money!!  So, I gave them all a chance but failed at every one of

them!  Maybe they worked for some people, but not for me.

Eventually, I just tossed that JUNK MAIL in the trash when I got

the mail.  I recognized it right away.  I can smell a money scam

from a mile away these days,  SO I THOUGHT.... I thought I could

sniff out a scam easily.  WAS I WRONG!!



..I LOVE THE INTERNET!!!



I was scanning thru a NEWSGROUP and saw an article stating to GET

CASH FAST!!  I thought... "Here on the Internet??  Well, I'll just

have to see what schemes could possibly be on the internet."  The

article described a way to MAIL A ONE DOLLAR BILL TO ONLY FIVE

PEOPLE AND MAKE $50,000 IN CASH WITHIN 4 WEEKS!  Well, the more I

thought about it, the more I became very curious.  Why?  Because

of the way it worked AND BECAUSE IT WOULD ONLY COST ME FIVE

DOLLARS (AND FIVE STAMPS), THAT'S ALL I EVER PAY.... EVER!!



Ok, so the $50,000 in cash was maybe a tough amount to reach, but

it was possible.  I figured that I could at least get a return of

$1,000 or so.  So I did it!!  As per the instructions in the

article, I mailed out ('snail mail'for you e-mail fanatics) a

single dollar bill to each of the five people on the list that

was contained in the article.  I included a small note, with the

dollar, that stated "Please Add Me To Your List."  I then removed

the first position name of the five names listed and moved

everyone up one position, and I put my name in position five of

the list.  This is how the money starts rolling in!  I then took

this revised article now with my name on the list and REPOSTED IT

ON AS MANY NEWSGROUPS AND LOCAL BULLETIN BOARD MESSAGE AREAS THAT

I KNEW.  I then waited to watch the money come in... prepared to

maybe receive about $1000 to $1500 in cash or so....



But what a welcome surprise when those envelopes kept coming in!!!

I knew what they were as soon as I saw the return addresses from

people all over the world - Most from the U.S., but some from

Canada, even some from Australia!  I tell you, THAT WAS EXCITING!!

So how much did I get in total return?  $1000? $5000?  Not even!!!

I received a total of $23,343!!!  I couldn't believe it!!



I now have a brand new black Acura Integra to speak for, due to

this!! Now after almost 8 months, I am ready to do it again!!! So

maybe it was possible to get $50,000 in cash, I don't know, but IT

COMPLETELY DEPENDS ON YOU, THE INDIVIDUAL!  You must follow

through and repost this article everywhere you can think of!

The more postings you achieve will determine how much cash will

arrive in your very own mailbox!!  It's just too easy to pass

up!!!



Let's review the reasons why you should do this:  The only cost

factors are for the five stamps, the 5 envelopes and the 5 one

dollar bills that you send out to the listed names by snail mail

(US Postal Service Mail).  Then just simply repost the article

(WITH YOUR NAME ADDED) to all the newsgroups and local BBS's you

can.  Then sit back and, (ironically), enjoy walking (you can run

if you like! :o)  ) down your driveway to your mailbox and scoop up

your rewards!!  We all have five dollars to put into such an easy

effortless investment with SPECTACULAR REALISTIC RETURNS OF

$15,000 to $25,000 in about 3-5 weeks!  So HOLD OFF ON THOSE

LOTTERY NUMBERS FOR TODAY, EAT AT HOME TONIGHT INSTEAD OF TAKEOUT

FROM McDONALDS AND INVEST FIVE DOLLARS IN THIS AMAZING MONEY

MAKING SYSTEM NOW!!!  YOU CAN'T LOSE!!



So how do you do it exactly, you ask?  I have carefully provided

the most detailed, yet straightforward instructions on how to

easily get this underway and get your cash on its way.  SO, ARE

YOU READY TO MAKE SOME CASH!!!??  HERE WE GO!!!

******************************************************************** 



*** (THE LIST OF NAMES IS AT THE END OF THIS ARTICLE.) ***



OK,  Read this carefully.  Get a printout of this information, if

you like, so you can easily refer to it as often as needed.  (Not

that it's difficult or anything.)



INSTRUCTIONS:



1.  Take a sheet of paper and write on it the following: "Please

add my name to your list".  This creates a service out of this

money making system and thus making it completely legal.  You are

not just randomly sending a dollar to someone, you are paying one

dollar for a legitimate service.  Make sure  you include your name

and address.  I assure you that,  again,  this is completely

legal!  For a neat little twist, also write what slot their name

was in:  "You were in slot 3", just to add a little fun!  This is

all about having fun and making money at the same time!



2.  Now fold this sheet of paper around a dollar bill, (no checks

or money orders), and put them into an envelope and send it on its

way to the five people listed.  The folding of the paper around

the bill will ensure its arrival to its recipient. THIS STEP IS

IMPORTANT!!  (Otherwise, some unscrupulous mail delivery person

may see what's inside and start helping himself to all the

thousands of envelopes arriving!)



3.  Now listen carefully, here's where you get YOUR MONEY COMING

TO YOUR MAILBOX.  Look at the list of five people;  remove the

first name from position one and move everyone on the list up

one slot on the list.  Position 2 name will now move to the

position 1 slot,  position 3 will now become position 2, 4 will

be 3, 5 will be 4.  Now put your name, address, zipcode AND

COUNTRY in position 5, the bottom position on the list.



4.  Now upload this updated file to as many newsgroups and local

bulletin boards' message areas & file sections as possible.  Give

a catchy description of the file so it gets noticed!!  Such as:

"NEED FAST CASH?, HERE IT IS!" or "NEED CASH TO PAY OFF YOUR

DEBTS??",  etc.  And the more uploads, the more money you will

make, and of course, the more money the others on the list will

make too.  LET'S ALL TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER BY BEING HONEST AND

BY PUTTING FORTH 120 PERCENT INTO THIS PROFITABLE & AMAZING

SYSTEM!!!  You'll reap the benefits, believe me!!! Set a goal for

the number of total uploads you'll post, such as 15-20 postings

or more!  Always have a goal in mind!!! If you can UUE encode the

file when uploading,  that will make it easier for the people to

receive it and have it downloaded to their hard drive.  That way

they get a copy of the article right on their computer without

hassles of viewing and then saving the article from the File menu.

DON'T ALTER THE FILE TYPE, leave it as an MS-DOS Text file. The

best test is to be able to view this file using Microsoft's

Notepad for Windows 3.x or WordPad for Windows '95.  (Do NOT use

the WordWrap option.  It will screw the margins up!) If the margins

look right without making the screen slide left or right when at

the ends of the sentences, you're in business!



5.  If you need help uploading, simply ask the sysop of the BBS,

or "POST" a message on a newsgroup asking how to post a file,

tell them who your Internet provider is and PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS BE

GLAD TO HELP.  I would try to describe how to do it but there are

simply too many internet software packages with slightly different

yet relatively simple ways to post or upload a file.  Just ask for

help or look in the help section for 'posting'. I do know that for

GNN, you simply select 'POST' then enter a catchy description

under the subject box, choose 'ATTACH', selecting 'UUE' and NOT

'TXT', then choose 'Browse' to go look for the file. Find your

text file, i.e. CASH.TXT, and click on it and choose 'OK'.  Place

a one line statement in the main body section of the message post

screen. Something like "Download this to read how to get cash

arriving in your mailbox with no paybacks!" or whatever.  Just

make sure it represents its true feasibility, NOT something

like... "Get one million dollars flooding in your mailbox in two

days!"  You'll never get ANY responses!



6.  And this is the step I like.  JUST SIT BACK AND ENJOY LIFE

BECAUSE CASH IS ON ITS WAY!!  Expect to see a little money

start to trickle in around 2 weeks, but AT ABOUT WEEKS 3 & 4, THE

MONEY STORM WILL HIT YOUR MAILBOX!! All you have to do is take it

out of the mailbox and try not to scream too loud (outside anyway)

when you realize YOU HIT THE BIG TIME AT LAST!!



7.  So go PAY OFF YOUR BILLS AND DEBTS and then get that something

special you always wanted or buy that special person in your life

(or the one you want in your life) a gift they'll never forget.

ENJOY LIFE!



8.  Now when you get low on this money supply,  simply re-activate

this file again; Reposting it in the old places where you

originally posted and possibly some new places you now know of.

Don't ever lose this file, always keep a copy at your reach for

when you ever need cash.  THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE TOOL THAT YOU CAN

ALWAYS RE-USE TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHEN CASH IS NEEDED!



9.  (This step added by Ken Korbel).  Hello, This is exciting

isn't it?!  While I'm on the list, just add a note saying "Please

include extra money tips" with your name & E-MAIL address, and I

will (FOR FREE) send you some neat methods to increase the money

you will receive with this plan. Why?... Why not? I'm not a

selfish jerk... I like helping out others. E-mail just makes it a

touch easier and cheaper, too!  After I drop off the list, I can

no longer offer you this advice, obviously, but maybe someone else

who gets my tips will offer and simply replace my name on this

step number 9. Good luck and give this plan your all, it will

definitely pay off! Like Mike said, HAVE FUN WITH IT!!!

                    When I bought this new PC

I received a great party box from Casady & Greene for Wamug. It has 
candy and party favors and two software packages. The first is their 
Spellchecker called Spell Checker. It replaces the old Thunder program. 
The second is a spreadsheet program called Let's Keep It Simple 
Spreadsheet, or KISS. I can demo them at the next open meeting we have. 
Just let me know. It will at least be different. A Party! They gave me 
these two copies to review and then to raffle, which I will do. Somebody 
give me an open date to work towards.

Is anyone else getting sick of getting junk mail on AOL? At  least two out
of three mesages I get are junk mail. I always tell them to take me off
their mailing list. The latest one doubled the messages instead of
removing my name. It's bad enough getting junk mail through snail mail.
It's adding insult to injury to have to pay for the time it takes to get
rid of the stuff.

We are using Thunder 7 at home for our spell-checker. It is excellent. It
does more than just check spelling. Among other things, it also  handles
smart quotes and replaces space runs with tabs and vice versa. I'm getting
the new version of it at work as soon as possible.

I'm a photojournalist covering the Republican National Convention in San
Diego, and I'm happy to report that, for the photographers, there is 
nary
a 'Doze machine in sight. In the Associated Press work space most of the
AP member photographers are using Powerbook 500 series with Nikon
Supercoolscans, there are a few digital cameras and some 180c's and even
some 165c's. Haven't seen any 5300's yet.

For their part, AP staff photographers are using all digital cameras. 
The
PC cards are being downloaded straight into PowerPC boxes. AP has 
digital
cameras covering the podium giving live feeds to a Mac under the camera
platform in the middle of the convention center and going straight out 
to
member papers from there.

United Press International is using film. The photoshop work is being
done on PowerMac 7500's and sent to Washington where they are 
transmitted
to UPI subscribers.

A few of us are even Newtons for caption notes!

Solidaritaetsgemeinschaft 
Vertragsrechtsschutz der 
Gewerbetreibenden


Ein gemeinnuetziger Verein der nicht gegruendet werden kann.... 


Wie alle Gewerbetreibenden und Freiberufler aus leidvoller Erfahrung
wissen sind Versicherungsgesellschaften, sonst immer schnell bei der Hand
wenn es um einen neuen Abschluss geht, gerade in Sachen
Werkvertrags-Rechtsschutz aeusserst zurueckhaltend, in den meisten Faellen
sogar absolut ablehnend eingestellt - wir jedenfalls (taetig im Bereich
Anlagentechnik und Stahlbau) haben in den vergangenen 15 Jahren keine
Gesellschaft zu einem Versicherungsabschluss hinreissen koennen. 

Zeigen Sie mir ein Unternehmen aus

  Hoch-/Tiefbau
  Schlosserei
  Architektur
  Ingenieurwesen
  Malerei
  Statik
  Stahlbau
  Montage
  etc.

welches ueber eine Vertragsrechtschutzversicherungen fuer
Werkvertragsleistungen verfuegt und ich loesche diese Seite sofort.


Rechtsstreitigkeiten aus Vertraegen mit Kunden oder Lieferanten sind also
in aller Regel mit einem erheblichen und vor allem, nicht ueberschaubaren
Eigenkostenrisiko verbunden und werden haeufig aus diesen
Risikoerwaegungen heraus gar nicht erst gefuehrt.

Aus dieser Situation heraus entstand nun bei uns bereits vor mehreren
Jahren die Idee zur Gruendung einer Solidargemeinschaft welche die, den
einzelnen Mitgliedern entstehenden Rechtsverfolgungskosten aus den
Beitragsleistungen aller Mitglieder finanziert und damit eben diesen Teil
der vom Versicherungsgewerbe nahezu rundweg ausgeschlossenen Risiken
kalkulierbar und damit ueberschaubar macht.
Diese Solidargemeinschaft sollte, so der Gedanke, keine
"Versicherungsgesellschaft" sondern lediglich eine Vereinigung von
Gewerbetreibenden sein welche sich, gerade und weil die etablierten
Versicherungen den Vertragsrechtsschutz nicht gewaehren, zu einem
eigenfinanzierten Selbstschutz-Buendnis zusammenfinden.

Der Grundgedanke des Zusammenschlusses lag darin, saemtliche Kosten aus
Rechtsstreitigkeiten einzelner Mitglieder auf die Gesamtheit aller
Mitglieder zu verteilen und damit dem einzelnen Mitglied der Gemeinschaft
die finanzielle Durchfuehrung seiner Gerichtsverfahren auf der Grundlage
berechenbarer Kosten zu ermoeglichen.

Darueberhinaus sollte die Moeglichkeit geschaffen werden durch sach- und
fachkundige Vertragsberatung schon vor oder waehrend eines
Vertragsabschlusses, spaetere Rechtsprobleme bereits im Vorfeld auf ein
Minimum zu reduzieren.

Im Falle eines dennoch entstehenden Rechtsstreites koennte der Verein, auf
Wunsch, fuer das Mitglied die Vorbereitung der Klage- bzw.
Klageerwiederungschrift anhand der Unterlagen des Mitgliedes uebernehmen
und/oder einen speziell fuer den jeweilgen Fall geeigneten Anwalt
auswaehlen bzw. vorschlagen. 


Also.... 

  die IDEE stand.

  fuenf Unternehmen waren die geistigen Vaeter der Idee und damit schon
einmal sichere
  Gruendungsmitglieder.

  ein Anwalt wurde mit der Ausarbeitung der Satzung beauftragt.

  Satzung und Erlaeuterungstext gingen per Post zur Stellungnahme bzw.
  Weiterempfehlung an die Industrie und Handelskammern der Bundesrepublik.

Die IHK-Essen... 

  lud zu einem Gespraech

  war von der Idee als solcher ueberaus begeistert

  und teilte dort gleich ihre Bedenken hinsichtlich der
Versicherungsaufsichtsbehoerde mit.

Das Bundesaufsichtsamt fuer das Versicherungswesen...
 
  meldete sich kurz darauf

  untersagte in der schriftlichen Form die "Ausuebung eines ungenehmigten 
  Versicherungsgewerbes"

  stellte in darauffolgenden Telefonaten die Erteilung einer
Sondergenehmigung wegen 
  Versicherungsnotstandes in Aussicht 

  tat dann nichts dergleichen und blieb bei seiner Untersagung


Fazit...
Wir sind nach wie vor der Meinung, dass die Verteilung von
Mitgliedsbeitraegen innerhalb des Kreises der, die Beitraege aufbringenden
Mitglieder keinesfalls in den Bereich des Versicherungsgewerbes
einzuordnen ist.

Aus dieser unserer festen UEberzeugung heraus haben wir uns entschlossen,
die Vereinsidee wieder aufleben zu lassen und suchen nun noch nach
mindestens zwei entschlossenen Gruendungsmitgliedern (das deutsche
Vereinsrecht schreibt sieben 
Gruendungsmitglieder zwingend vor) die mit uns zusammen die
Vereinsgruendung gegenueber dem Bundesaufsichtsamt durchfechten wollen.

Dies gilt um so mehr als zwischenzeitlich im WDR-Hoerfunk von einer
doerflich begrenzten aber immerhin offiziellen "Lebensversicherung fuer
Schweine" berichtet wurde - wir sehen dies zumindest als einen
Praezedenzfall an.


Interesse...??

This is from the FreePPP website:

FreePPP 2.5 v2 has been sent to Info-Mac and should be in wide distribution by
Aug. 23rd. This is a huge bug fix release with no new features. If you are
currently using FreePPP without any problems then there's no need to
upgrade. If you have a Global Village modem you'll definately want this
release since it fixes some problems with GV products.

NOTE: After you install FreePPP 2.5v2, we recommend that you rebuild your
desktop. If you do not, FreePPP Menu may not properly recognize the
FreePPPSetup application.

It has helped me.

QED Rates Apple Macintosh #1 in Education Market Share, #1 in Purchase
Intent

Macintosh Installed Base Up 5 Points Over Last Year

CUPERTINO, California--Aug. 5, 1996--New market research shows that 
Apple
Macintosh is the leading computer platform in the kindergarten through
high school market, and the one most educators intend to buy in the
coming school year.

According to Quality Education Data's (QED) "1996-97 Technology
Purchasing Forecast," the Macintosh now accounts for 41 percent of the
computers in the K-12 education market, up five full share points from
last year. Apple II computers account for 20 percent of the installed
base, bringing Apple's total share of computers in U.S. K-12 public
schools to 61 percent.

The QED report indicates that as the installed base of Apple IIs is
replaced, educators have turned to the multimedia-rich Macintosh. It
shows Macintosh as the computer of choice for more than half (55 
percent)
of all intended school purchases in 1996-97. This is more than seven
times the number of computers educators plan to buy from the next most
mentioned brands, IBM and Compaq, each with seven percent.

"There is no doubt that the preference for Macintosh remains strong in
the K-12 market," said QED president Jeanne Hayes. "Our research clearly
shows that Macintosh is by far the preferred computer platform in the
education market. The majority of school districts plan their technology
futures around this platform."

Six of 10 Computers in Schools are Apple

According to Field Research Corp., there are 6.4 million computers in
U.S. K-12 public schools today. At Apple's current 61 percent market
share, this translates into 2.6 million Macintosh computers and 1.3
million Apple IIs, a total of almost 4 million Apple computers. On
average, six out of 10 computers used in K-12 public schools today are
Apple-branded.

"The five point growth in Macintosh installed base validates Apple's 
role
as an industry leader in multimedia technology for education," says
Patricia Montgomery, senior director of Apple's Worldwide Education
Market. division. "For nearly 20 years, Apple has been committed to
providing schools with the best possible tools to enhance the learning
and teaching environment. Macintosh is the platform of the 21st century,
integrating multimedia, collaboration, simulation, and Internet access,
providing students and educators expanded options for creative
expression."

Macintosh #1 in Multimedia, Internet, and Software in the Education 
Market

Apple is at the forefront of bringing multimedia capabilities and
Internet access to the classroom--both high on the list of educators'
priorities. According to QED's Educational Technology Trends, 8th 
Edition
(12/95), Macintosh is the most popular multimedia platform in schools,
with 77 percent of all K-12 school districts that use multimedia 
computer
systems using Macintosh.

Interest in the Internet continues to grow in the education market. with
nearly 40 percent of all K-12 schools currently accessing the Internet.
In fact, schools with Macintosh computers have embraced the Internet
faster than schools using DOS/Windows-based systems. Forty-five percent
of all schools that use only Macintosh computers access the Internet,
compared to 27 percent of schools that use only DOS/Windows PCs. (10/95,
Field Research).

Due to the popularity of Macintosh among educators, the platform enjoys 
a
strong base of third party developer support. According to a Spring 1996

MONEY FOUND!!!!  Taking 5 minutes to read what follows can
change your life :


  I saw an article in an internet newsgroup telling me I could
  make $50,000 within a month for an investment of only $5.

  I thought it  was a huge joke. I spoke  to my wife, attorney
  and friends about  it, and they all agreed it  was some kind
  of scam. I  can't stand scams, because  usually someone gets
  burned, and I didn't want it to be me. Of course, I rejected
  the idea at  first. after a short period of  about two weeks
  ,I thought  : "I have already  heard of such things.  But on
  the Internet ?!?!? ". I decided  that even if I had to throw
  5$ into the fire, I wouldn't  mind it that much, and gave it
  a try .After all I needed a LOT more than five dollars.


  Two weeks  later, I began  receiving money in  the mail!   I
  could not believe it! Soon, hundreds,  and then thousands of
  dollars began to  roll in. Within 4 weeks, I  had received a
  total of $32,445!  It came from everywhere in  the world. My
  bank account has changed its "-"  into a big "+" (++++)!!!,I
  bought myself a car and things I wanted for a long long time
  for my wife and kids!


  If you follow the three steps  below, there is no reason why
  the  same shouldn't  happen  to you!  This  is a  legitimate
  investment  opportunity. You  invest $5,  and you  receive a
  return on  your investment. So  does the next  investor. NOT
  ILLEGAL, NOT A CHAIN LETTER- PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE.

  If  you  are not  interested,  then  don't participate,  but
  please print this article and pass  it on to someone who may
  be interested, so they can take advantage.

  The procedure is simple: 1) Write your name and address on 5
  sheets of paper.   Below that, write the  words, "Please add
  me to  your mailing  list." Fold  $1 note  or bank  draft or
  money order  in each  piece of  paper and  mail them  to the
  following 5 addresses.:



  1. Bill Brown
     148 South Downlen #796
     Beaumont, Tx. 77707     USA

  2. Olivier Arcadipane
      237 rue Francois Andre
      7390 Quaregnon       BELGIUM

  3. Josef Malzer,
     Brandhof 1
     4701 Bad Schallerbach
     EUROPE - AUSTRIA

  4. Jeff Durham
     RR3 Box 263-E
     Mt. Vernon, KY  40456

  5. Mac Johnson
      30556 Mira Loma Drive
      Temecula, CA 92592     USA


  2) Now remove the top name from the list, and move the other
  four names up. In other words,  #5 becomes #4 and so on. Put
  your name as the  fifth one on the list.   Use a simple text
  editor such as  Notepad,  in your   "accessories" window (If
  you have  MS-Windows),or DOS  editor.   In fact,  any editor
  will do.

  3) Post  the article to at  least 200 newsgroups.  There are
  17,000, so  it shouldn't  be hard  to find  that many.   Try
  posting to as  many  newsgroups as you can,   and the bigger
  the newsgroup is,  the more  people are to see your message!

  You  are now  in  the mail  order  investment business,  and
  should start seeing returns within a week or two. Of course,
  the more newsgroups you post to, the greater your return is.
  If you  wish to remain anonymous,  you may use  a psuedonym,
  call yourself  "The Manager", "The Boss",  whatever but make
  sure your address is correct.

  Now, here is why the system works:

  -Of every  200 posts  I made, I  received 5  responses. Yes,
  only 5. You make $5 for every 200 posts with your name at #5.

  -Each person who  sent you $1 now also  makes 200 additional
  postings with your name at #4. ie. 1000 postings. On average
  therefore, 50 people will send you  $1 with your name at #4.
  $50.

  -Your 50 new agents make 200 postings each with your name at
  #3 or  10,000 postings.  Average return  500 people  = $500.
  They make  200 postings  each with  your name  at #2=100,000
  postings=5000 return at $1 each=$5000.

  -Finally, 5,000 people  make 200 postings with  your name at
  #1 and  you get a return  of $50,000 before your  name drops
  off the list. AND THATS IF  EVERYONE DOWN THE LINE MAKES 200
  POSTINGS! Total income in one cycle=$55,000.

  From time to  time, when you see your name  no longer on the
  list,  you  take the  latest  posting  that appears  in  the
  newsgroups, and  send out another $5,  and put your  name at
  #5, and start posting again. Remember,  200 postings is only
  a guideline. the more you post, the greater the return.

  Lets review why you should do this. THE ONLY COST IS $5, AND
  5 STAMPS, AND 5 ENVELOPES.  Anyone can afford $5 for such an
  effortless investment with such SPECTACULAR RETURNS.

  Some people have said to me,  "what happens if the scheme is
  played out and no one sends me any money?  "Big Deal, so you
  lose $5-but what are the chances of that happening ?? Do you
  Realize that  NOBODY cares for  the LEGAL chance  of winning
  such  a BIG  money as  50,000.00  $$$$ ????  and  all for  a
  microscopic investment of five  separate dollars? just think
  of all  of the new  Internet users that  join the  net every
  day!!!

  There are  millions of internet  users, and millions  of new
  net surfers every  month !!!  This is the  great plus of the
  Internet,  people all over the world can hear you and listen
  carefully if you  talk reasonably.  Everyone  will take that
  chance !  I agree,  If  it wasn't the  Internet,  and  was a
  small circle  of people,  the chance  wouldn't have  been so
  small.  the amount of money had to be 200 times bigger,  and
  the chances were zero.  It wouldn't succeed.

  But here, on the Internet, it is a giant village,  where new
  thousands of members join in every day ! you CAN'T lose !!!!

  Remember- read the instructions  carefully, and play fairly.
  That's the  only way this will  work. Get a printout  so you
  can refer back to this article easily.

  Try to  keep a  list of  everyone that  sends you  money and
  always keep an eye on the  postings to make sure everyone is
  playing fairly. You know where your name should be.

  REMEMBER-HONESTY IS  THE BEST  POLICY.  YOU  DO NOT  NEED TO
  CHEAT THIS  IDEA TO  MAKE MONEY!!   BESIDES,NOT  PLAYING THE
  GAME  FAIRLY  IS ILLEGAL.SO  LET'S  BE  REASONABLE AND  PLAY
  FAIRLY,SO WE CAN ALL ENJOY THE INTERNET GOLD MINE.

  GOOD LUCK  FOR YOU ALL, And  remember, play fair  and you'll
  win,  I don't want to mention what might happen to those who
  won't.   AND  AGAIN,SEE  YOU NEXT  TIME  WITH SOMETHING  YOU
  WANTED FOR A LONG TIME !!!

!!!!!$$$$$$ EASY MONEY, AND IT REALLY WORKS!!!!!!, TRY IT AND YOU'LL 
BE HAPPY!!!  :o)

$$$Take five minutes to read this and it WILL change your life.$$$
 
 I finally decided to read one of these articles in an internet 
 newsgroup describing how to make $50,000.00 in only one month from 
 a $5.00 investment.
 
 Of course I thought this was rediculous ,or some type of pyramid.
 I talked it over with my family, an attorney, and my friends, and
 they all agreed it was some sort of scam.I hate scams because
 usually someone gets burned, and I didn't want it to be me!
 I blew it off for a few weeks then saw another one in a
 newsgroup I go to alot and thought, "Maybe this is legitimate!".
 Besides, whats $5.00 , I spend more than that in the morning on
 my way to work on coffee and cigs for the day.
 
 
 Well, two weeks later,I began recieving money in the mail!
 I couldn't believe it! Not just a little , I mean big bucks!
 At first only a few hundred dollars, then a week later, a
 couple of thousand , then BOOM . By the end of the fourth
 week , I had recieved nearly $47,000.00. It came from all
 over the world.And every bit of it perfectly legal and on the
 up and up. I've been able to pay off all my bills and still had
 enough left over for a nice vacation for me and my family.
 
 Not only does it work for me, it works for other folks as well.
 Markus Valppu says he made $57,883 in four weeks.  Dave Manning 
 claims he made $53,664 in the same amount of time.  Dan Shepstone
 says it was only $17,000 for him.  Do I know these folks?  No, 
 but when I read how they say they did it, it made sense to me. 
 Enough sense that I'm taking a similar chance with $5 of my own money. 
 Not a big chance, I admit--but one with incredible potential, because
 $5 is all anyone ever invests in this system.  Period.  That's all
 Markus, Dave, or Dan invested, yet their $5 netted them tens of
thousands
 of dollars each, in a safe, legal, completely legitimate way. 
 Here's how it works in 3 easy steps:
 
STEP 1.
 
  Invest your $5 by writing your name and address on five seperate
        pieces of paper along with the words:
 "PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST." 
  (In this way, you're not just sending a dollar to someone;  you're
        paying for a legitimate service.)  Fold a $1 bill, money order,
or bank
        note inside each paper, and mail them by standard U. S. Mail to
the following
        five addresses:

 1-  Marco Monet
      409 N.E. 107 St.
      Miami, Florida, USA 33161
 
 2-  Alain Renaud
     2638 Augustin-Cantin
     Montreal, QC,Canada
     H3K 1E1
 
 3- Steve Ferguson
     1076 Mystic Lane North
     Troy, OH, USA 45373
 
 4-  Fern Suarez
     Mallorca 112
     Hato Rey, P.R., USA, 00917

 5-  Philippe
     2104 De Mexico
     Chomedey, Laval
     Quebec, Canada 	
     H7M 3C6	

STEP 2.

    Now remove the top name from the list, and move the
    other names up.This way, #5 becomes #4 and so on.
    Put your name in as the fifth one on the list.


STEP 3.

    Post the article to at least 200 newsgroups. There are at
    least 17000 newsgroups at any given moment in time.
    Try posting to as many newsgroups as you can.Remember
    the more groups you post to, the more people will see your
    article and send you cash!


STEP 4.

    You are now in business for yourself, and should start seeing
    returns within 7 to 14 days! Remember, the internet is new
    and huge. There is no way you can lose.
 
    Now here is how and why this system works:
 
    Out of every block of 200 posts I made, I got back 5 responses.
    Yes, thats right,only 5. You make $5.00 in cash, not checks or
    money orders, but real cash with your name at #5.
 
    Each additional person who sent you $1.00 now also makes 200
    additional postings with your name at #4, 1000 postings.On
    average then, 50 people will send you $1.00 with your name at
    #4,....$50.00 in your pocket!
 
    Now these 50 new people will make 200 postings each with your
    name at #3 or 10,000 postings. Average return, 500 people= $500.
    They make 200 postings each with your name at #2= 100,000
    postings=5000 returns at $1.00 each=$5,000.00 in cash!
 
    Finally, 5,000 people make 200 postings each with your name at
    #1 and you get a return of $50,000 before your name drops off
    the list.And that's only if everyone down the line makes only 200
    postings each! Your total income for this one cycle is $55,000.
 
    From time to time when you see your name is no longer on the list,
    you take the latest posting you can find and start all over again.

                The end result depends on you. You must follow through
                and repost this  article everywhere you can think of.
The
                more  postings you  make,  the more  cash  ends  up in 
your
                mailbox.   It's too easy and too cheap to pass up!!!

    So thats it. Pretty simple sounding stuff, huh? But believe me, it
    works. There are millions of people surfing the net every day, all
    day, all over the world. And 100,000 new people get on the net
    every day. You know that, you've seen the stories in the paper.
    So, my friend, read and follow the simple instructions and play
    fair. Thats the key, and thats all there is to it.Print this out
    right now so you can refer back to this article easily.Try to keep
    an eye on all the postings you made to make sure everyone is
    playing fairly. You know where your name should be.

                 If you're really not sure or still think this can't be
for real, then
                don't do it. But please print this article and pass it
along to
                someone you know who really needs the money, and see
                what happens.


    REMEMBER....HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.YOU DON'T
    NEED TO CHEAT THE BASIC IDEA TO MAKE THE MONEY!
    GOOD LUCK TO ALL,AND PLEASE PLAY FAIR AND YOU WILL
    WIN AND MAKE SOME REAL INSTANT FREE CASH!

*** By the way, if you try to deceive people by posting the messages
with your name in the list and not sending the money to the people
already included, you will not get much. I know someone who did this
and only got about $150 (and that's after two months). Then he sent
the 5 bills, people added him to their lists, and in 4-5 weeks he had
over $10,000!

                TRY IT AND YOU'LL BE HAPPY!!!  :o) !!!!!!!!!!

"Maybe this IS legitimate!". Besides, what's $5.00, I spend more than
that
in the morning on my way to work on coffee and cigs for the day. Well,
two
weeks later, I began receiving money in the mail! I couldn't believe it!
Not just a little, I mean big bucks! At first only a few hundred
dollars,
then a week later, a couple of thousand, then BOOM! By the end of the
fourth weekm I had received nearly $47,000.00. It came form all over the
world. And every bit of it perfectly leagal and on the up and up. I've
been
able to pay off all my bills and still had enough left over for a nice
vacation for me and my family. Not only does it work for me, it works
for
other folks as well. Markus Valppu says he made $57,883 in FOUR WEEKS!!
Dave Manning claims he made $52,664 in the same amount of time. Dan
Shepstone says it was only $17,000 for him. Do I know these folks? No,
but
when I read how they say they did it, it made sense to me. Enough sense
that I'm taking a similar chance with $5 of my own money. Not a big
chance,
I admit--but one with incredible potential, because $5 is all anyone
ever
invests in this system. PERIOD! That's all Markusm Dave or Dan incestedm
yet their $5 netted them tens of thousands of dollars each, in a safe,
legal, completely legitimate way. Here's how it works in 3 easy steps:
STEP
1. Invest your $5 by writing your name and address on five separate
pieces
of paper along with the words, "PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST." (In
this way, you're not just sending a dollar to someone; you're paying for
a
legitimate service.) Fold a $1 bill, money order, or bank note inside
each
paper, and mail then by standard U.S. Mail to the following five
addresses:


1. Marco Monet 409 N.E. 107 St. Miami, Florida, USA 33161 
2. BW 11 West Seneca Circle Geneseo, NY 14454  
3. Jason Segal 5961 Glenhaven cres. Norfolk, VA 23508 
4. Rick Roehrich 478 Conklintown Rd. Ringwood, NJ, USA 07456
5. Mathieu Gagnon 2815 Peribonka, Laval, Quebec, Canada, H7E-1B7

STEP 2. Now remove the top name from the list, and move the other names
up.
This way, #5 becomes #4 and so on. Put YOUR NAME in as the fifth one on
the
list! STEP 3. Post the article to at least 200 newsgroups. There are at
least 17,000 newsgroups at any given moment in time. Try posting to as
many
newsgroups as you can. Remember, the more newsgroups you post to, the
more
people will see your article and send YOU cash! STEP 4. You are now in
business for yourself, and should start seeing returns within 7 to 14
days!
Remember, the internet is new and huge. There is NO WAY you can lose.
Now
here is how and why this system works: Out of every block of 200 posts I
made, I got back 5 responses. Yes, that's right, only 5. You make $5.00
in
cash, not checks or money orders, but real cash with your name at #5.
Each
additional person who sent you $1.00 now also makes 200 additional
postings
with your name at #4, 1000 postings! On average then, 50 people will
send
you $1.00 with your name at #4,....$50.00 in your pocket! Now those 50
new
people will make 200 postings each with your name at #3 or 10,000
postings.
Average return, 500 people= $500. They make 200 postings each with your
name at #2= $100,000. Postings=5,000 returns at $1.00 each=$5,000.00 in
CASH!! Finally, 5,000 people make 200 postings each with your name at #1
and you get a return of $50,000 before your name drops off the list. And
that's only if everyone down the line makes only 200 postings! As you
can
see, the potential of earning a lot of money for only $5 is great!! But,
in
order for it to work, you must follow the instructions and send your
money.
The internet is huge, let's all take advantage of it and help each OTHER
out! GOOD LUCK...and enjoy your new found wealth!

If you do recall it at 2:38 a.m., give Bob a call. I know he'd appreciate it.

Yes, I am in your computer. If I get bored, I cause it to crash. Just to
hear the things you say. ( Your very inventive with words. I've never
heard some of those before).
