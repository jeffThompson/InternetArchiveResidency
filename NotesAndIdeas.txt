NOTES AND IDEAS

- - - - - - - - 

CURATORIAL:

+ all texts ordered by brightness of facsimile
		- refine by a certain word (perhaps 'brightness')
				- try: "brightness AND mediatype:texts OR text OR Text" in advanced search to get CSV files of identifiers

+ "Search Query as Curatorial Rubric"
		- each post titled by the search query?

+ every time the page is loaded it is re-curated with different posts (unstable platform, always re-organized)
		- lots of pre-curated content?
		- runs a python script (or JS?) to make a brand new one each time

+ much larger post than could ever be done by hand - curating thousands of items into little tiny thumbnails
		- how then does this become a meaningful experience, not just reorganizing the archive itself

+ search cross-references newspapers? Google?
		- NYT/Guardian API: http://blog.blprnt.com/source-code-tutorial

+ tag posts with all metadata from the Archive (using similar system for Comps on L&O)

+ pairs
		- different media? same?
		- video with text?
		- forms a kind of narrative?
		- built from skeletal structure?

+ curate by download count
		- work with the least-downloaded materials?

TECHNICAL:
+ get list of IDs for bulk download
		- advanced search terms: brightness AND mediatype:texts OR text OR Text AND format:pdf
		- search: http://archive.org/advancedsearch.php
		- download as CSV

+ bulk download using wget
		- some details here (great starting point):
				http://blog.archive.org/2012/04/26/downloading-in-bulk-using-wget
		- wget command being used:
				wget -r -H -nc -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -e robots=off -l1 -P 'downloadedFiles/' -i itemlist.txt -A .pdf -B 'http://archive.org/download/'
		- changing --cut-dirs=3 to --cut-dirs=2 will download files into unique directories (which might be desired)
		- command -P 'downloadedFiles/' saves into a folder called 'downloadedFiles'

+ ImageMagick to convert PDF to images
		- command: convert -density 150 -resize 800x "input.pdf" "output.png"
		- density = resolution
		- if multi-page, files will be titled output-0.png, output-1.png, etc
