NOTES AND IDEAS

- - - - - - - -

TO TRY:

+ text >> auto-summary >> search term >> text >> repeat
		- start with the most-downloaded text

+ first page of PDF with Google's first 'similar image' result

+ search cross-references newspapers? Google?
		- NYT/Guardian API: http://blog.blprnt.com/source-code-tutorial

+ top hit (or most viewed, or most rated, etc) in all media of a search term
		- ex: most downloaded item with the term "download"

+ all texts ordered by brightness of facsimile
		- refine by a certain word (perhaps 'brightness')
				- try: "brightness AND mediatype:texts OR text OR Text" in advanced search to get CSV files of identifiers

+ brightest text by "brightness" search, darkest by "darkest"

+ curate by download count
		- work with the least-downloaded materials?

DESIGN IDEAS/THOUGHTS:

+ grid of shows:
		- intro post with title of idea, brief synopsis, link to search query if applicable
		- each post a square image, then descriptive link below

+ random placement and overlap 
		- would have to make using JS/JQuery not PHP
		- CRAZY looking and inpenetrable
		- and overload of materials with endless scrolling
		- rearrange if you scroll past?
		- slowly rotating?
		
		<script>

CURATORIAL IDEAS/THOUGHTS:

+ "algorithm" means instructions, a recipe: need not be digital

+ "Search Query as Curatorial Rubric"
		- each post titled by the search query?

+ every time the page is loaded it is re-curated with different posts (unstable platform, always re-organized)
		- lots of pre-curated content?
		- runs a python script (or JS?) to make a brand new one each time

+ much larger post than could ever be done by hand - curating thousands of items into little tiny thumbnails
		- how then does this become a meaningful experience, not just reorganizing the archive itself

+ search cross-references newspapers? Google?
		- NYT/Guardian API: http://blog.blprnt.com/source-code-tutorial

+ tag posts with all metadata from the Archive (using similar system for Comps on L&O)

+ pairs
		- different media? same?
		- video with text?
		- forms a kind of narrative?
		- built from skeletal structure?

TECHNICAL:

+ delete all posts from Tumblr
	- http://devlab.ca/2013/08/delete-all-of-your-tumblr-posts-without-closing-your-blog/
	- http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2013/05/11/how-to-delete-all-tumblr-posts/#.UjcOKLzfZBG
	
+ get list of IDs for bulk download
		- advanced search terms: brightness AND mediatype:texts OR text OR Text AND format:pdf
		- search: http://archive.org/advancedsearch.php
		- download as CSV

+ bulk download using wget
		- some details here (great starting point):
				http://blog.archive.org/2012/04/26/downloading-in-bulk-using-wget
		- wget command being used:
				wget -r -H -nc -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -e robots=off -l1 -P 'downloadedFiles/' -i itemlist.txt -A .pdf -B 'http://archive.org/download/'
		- changing --cut-dirs=3 to --cut-dirs=2 will download files into unique directories (which might be desired)
		- command -P 'downloadedFiles/' saves into a folder called 'downloadedFiles'

+ ImageMagick to convert PDF to images
		- command: convert -density 150 -resize 800x "input.pdf" "output.png"
		- density = resolution
		- if multi-page, files will be titled output-0.png, output-1.png, etc
