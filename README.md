Internet Archive Residency
========================

Working files and documentation for a residency with the [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org), algorithmically-curating a series from the archive's collection.

Currently developing a Python-based web scraper what can do custom searches, returning results as JSON dictionaries with metadata and download links for the files.
